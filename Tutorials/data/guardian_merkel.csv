The head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said Poland’s “LGBT free zones” are “humanity-free zones” that have no place in the European Union in her strongest criticism yet of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party.
In a wide-ranging 77-minute speech spanning from coronavirus to the climate emergency, Von der Leyen pledged to build “a union of equality” and criticised European member states that watered down EU foreign policy messages on human rights.
She made plain her disapproval of Poland’s rightwing nationalist government, which has often hit out at “LGBT ideology”, while a number of Polish towns declared themselves “LGBT-ideology free zones”.
“Being yourself is not your ideology,” Von der Leyen told applauding MEPs in the European parliament in Brussels. “It’s your identity,” she said. “So I want to be crystal clear – LGBTQI-free zones are humanity free zones. And they have no place in our union.”
The EU is locked in a long-running dispute with Poland over the rule of law, since the ruling Law and Justice party embarked on policies that weaken independent courts. With no end in sight, that fight is set to intensify, as Von der Leyen signalled she would not back down on linking EU funds to financial probity, following questions over the use of European money in Hungary and the Czech Republic. She said protecting the EU budget “against any kind of fraud, corruption and conflict of interest” was “non-negotiable”.
The commission president lamented that EU foreign policy could be “delayed, watered down or held hostage for other motives”, as she called for an end to national vetoes.
Brussels has long called for an end to national vetoes on foreign policy, but Von der Leyen – who has pledged to lead a “geopolitical commission” – made the point by criticising EU governments for blocking stronger positions.
The EU, Von der Leyen said, needed to call out human rights abuses, whether in Hong Kong or over the fate of the Uighurs. “But what holds us back? Why are even simple statements on EU values delayed, watered down or held hostage for other motives? When member states say Europe is too slow, I say to them be courageous and finally move to qualified majority voting – at least on human rights and sanctions implementation.”
She promised her officials would draft a “Magnitsky act”, a targeted sanctions regime to punish human-rights offenders. Similar legislation already exists in the US and was recently introduced in the UK. The acts take their name from the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow jail aged 37, after uncovering a massive tax fraud by state officials.
The commission president, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, criticised the Russian government by describing the poisoning of the opposition activist Alexei Navalny as “not a one-off” and part of a pattern of behaviour. “This pattern is not changing – and no pipeline will change that,” she added in a cryptic reference to the German-Russian Nord Stream II pipeline from which Merkel’s government is under pressure to withdraw its support.
Von der Leyen was delivering her first “state of the union” speech, since beginning a five-year term last December. The annual speech to the European parliament, an idea consciously modelled on its US namesake, is intended to set out EU legislative priorities.
In the speech that cited Andrei Sakharov, Margaret Thatcher and John Hume, she struck an upbeat tone about EU unity, after a shaky start when EU member states closed borders and slapped export bans on medical supplies.
Having chided EU governments in the past for failing to support Italy in its hour of need, Von der Leyen struck a more optimistic note, saying member states had overcome their differences; including by agreeing a €750bn (£688bn) recovery plan.
“We turned fear and division between member states into confidence in our union,” she claimed. She said the EU needed more powers to tackle future pandemics and vowed to create an agency for biomedical advanced research and development, an equivalent to the US agency funding vaccine research, Barda.
Without naming Donald Trump, she made a few swipes at the US president, criticising “vaccine nationalism” and major powers, who are “pulling out of institutions or taking them hostage for their own interests”. But the EU could be on a collision course with a new Democratic incumbent of the White House, as Von der Leyen promised to revive plans for an EU digital tax in the absence of an international agreement. Barack Obama’s administration complained that Brussels was unfairly singling out US tech giants.
As widely trailed, Von der Leyen proposed the EU should cut greenhouse gas emissions by “at least 55%” by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Green campaigners have welcomed the increase in ambition (upping the current 40% reduction target) but fear “an accounting trick” in how the new target will be calculated.
Preoccupied by coronavirus and foreign policy crises, EU leaders have given little attention to Brexit in recent months. Von der Leyen said the chances of an agreement were fading with every day that passed, as she warned the UK government not to renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson signed last year. Noting that the Brexit deal had been ratified by MEPs and MPs, Von der Leyen said it could not be “unilaterally changed, disregarded, disapplied. This is a matter of law and trust and good faith.”
Von der Leyen, who is the first female president in the commission’s 63-year history, said the EU had to do more to confront racism in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests. In a move that could trigger conflict with sovereignty-conscious member states, she proposed extending the list of EU crimes to cover all forms of hate crime and hate speech, whether linked to race, religion, gender or sexuality.
She promised to appoint the European commission’s first-ever anti-racism coordinator “to keep the issue “at the top of our agenda”.

On the rocky road towards Germany’s post-Merkel future, one thing used to seem certain: the shoes of the first female, Protestant East German scientist at the top of German politics would be filled by a male Catholic Rhinelander with a law degree.
That description still fits all the three official candidates who at a party congress in early December will pitch to lead Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, the indispensable behemoth of postwar politics in Europe’s largest economy.
But the pandemic has realigned the stars for some of its top politicians to the extent that CDU insiders worry the leadership race’s most likely outcome no longer looks ideal, and the ideal outcome for the greater good of the party looks unlikely.
The impressive lead the conservatives have built up through their handling of the Covid-19 threat, they fear, could melt away as a squabbling party emerges from the shadow of the chancellor that has unified them for the last 15 years.
Merkel, who will not be running for a fifth term at federal elections in 2021, has already had to tear up her succession plan once: her designated continuity candidate, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who took charge of the CDU in December 2018, announced her resignation a year later, her authority diminished by a series of internal power struggles.
Before the onset of Covid-19, a new chair was due to be crowned at a party congress in late April. Armin Laschet, the moderate state premier of North-Rhine-Westphalia, looked like the top contender after winning over the ambitious young health minister, Jens Spahn, as his number two.
Laschet, a loyal defender of Merkel’s refugee policy in 2015, also has the advantage that his home turf is Germany’s most populous state, providing almost 30% of the 1,001 delegates who get to cast their vote on the future leadership. But the 59-year-old with Wallonian roots has floundered during the pandemic, in which he emerged as one of the most prominent voices of relaxing social distancing restrictions – only to then have to coordinate Germany’s first “second lockdown” following a Covid-19 outbreak at an abattoir in Gütersloh. In the eyes of many voters, “pushy Laschet” looked more concerned with local business lobbyists than the welfare of the country as a whole.
“It’s hard to imagine Laschet staring down Putin, Xi or Trump,” said one previously sympathetic CDU delegate.
As Laschet’s popularity ratings nosedived, another conservative politician rose to unseen heights: polls showed the Bavarian premier Markus Söder, who had introduced a lockdown in Germany’s southernmost state before it came into place in the rest of the country, to be the most popular politician in the country.
“In a world that is increasingly marked by insecurities – through migration movements, climate change or global pandemics – we are seeing a high preparedness to trade some basic rights in exchange for stability,” says Wolfgang Merkel (no relation), a political scientist at Berlin’s Humboldt University.
A recent study authored by Merkel shows populist attitudes in Germany to be in steep decline after rising during the refugee crisis – a trend, he says, which was accelerated by strong statesmanship by established parties at the height of the pandemic.
“For governments, there is a new premium on leaders who can demonstrate strength and act decisively, albeit without the populist rhetoric. For the CDU, that means polls will be crucial for choosing its chancellor candidate, and for now they point towards Söder rather than Laschet.”
As the leader of the CDU’s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), Söder won’t be in the running when delegates gather for a socially distanced one-day congress in Stuttgart this winter, most likely on 4 December.
But he could become the two parties’ candidate for the chancellory – an option that has been tried before, with an unhappy ending for the conservatives. Both in 1980 and 2002 the CDU/CSU lost an election as a result, and many still believe that Bavarian politicians with their broad accents and overtly Catholic brand of conservatism simply cannot win enough votes north of the river Main.
Söder’s growing band of vocal admirers point out that their man is in fact from Franconia, and a Protestant at that. “He’s the least Bavarian leader the CSU has ever had,” says one fan.
For the 6ft 4in southerner to run, however, he would need the support of the head of the CDU in Berlin: something that Laschet would be as unlikely to offer as Friedrich Merz, the veteran hardliner and Merkel critic who is seen as the number two in the three-horse race for the leadership.
Some Christian Democrat MPs envision a “dream ticket” of Söder and Spahn, whose star has also shone brightly during the pandemic. But for the openly gay 40-year-old to run for the leadership would require reneging on his deal with Laschet. “In politics everyone loves betrayal, but no one loves a traitor,” said an official at the CDU headquarters when asked about such an option.
There’s an outside chance that the fiendishly complicated reshuffle at the top of Germany’s biggest party could benefit the outside candidate: Norbert Röttgen, the third Catholic lawyer from Rhineland-Westphalia on the ballot.
After leading the CDU to a crushing defeat in his home state in 2012 and losing his job in Merkel’s second cabinet as a result, the former environment minister has slowly crept back into the limelight through his role as chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee.
As the Alexei Navalny/novichok affair has forced Germany to reconsider its approach to Russia, Röttgen’s outspoken views have impressed conservatives who are frustrated with Laschet and Söder’s soft-pedalling. But the suave, sometimes over-confident 55-year-old’s biggest asset could be his openness to ceding the chancellor candidacy to Söder. If Röttgen made it to the second round, he might end up with the votes of the embittered supporters of one of the two frontrunners almost by accident.
Merkel’s line of succession, which has been planned, postponed and redrawn continuously over the last decade, could in the end be a matter of chance.

Books about the contemporary state of a country are hard to pull off. They need to capture the sweep of recent history and sundry quirks of culture, while weaving in their author’s passions, aversions and contacts. Add to this the publisher’s requirements that anything currently written about Britain’s relations with Europe is framed polemically and the result is a title such as Why the Germans Do it Better: Notes from a Grown-Up Country.
John Kampfner’s polemic treads the accompanying line between curiosity and sententiousness. It taps smartly into the hunch that Germany has got a lot of things right that Britain has not, not least in the recent response to Covid-19.
A veteran newspaper correspondent in Germany during the Wendezeit (“time of changes”), after the collapse of East Germany in 1989/90, he is drawn to revisit the country and, as next month marks 30 years of reunification, it’s an ideal moment to take stock. Inevitably, Angela Merkel looms large, having been in power for 15 of those years. In essence, this is a hymn of praise to the Federal Republic under her leadership. For those unhappy about the direction of a Britain “mired in monolingual mediocrity”, as Kampfner puts it, thriving on a TV diet of war documentaries and tone-deaf British politicians, it looks like a very attractive alternative indeed.
Merkel’s status as an icon is sealed by admiration for her bravely open-handed policy on migration in the refugee crisis of 2015, when the rest of Europe was parsimonious with its assistance. As a well-researched chapter here on those events and their aftermath concludes, this was the moment that created the view of Merkel as the high priestess of liberal values.
In other areas, more questionable assumptions abound. On a trip back across the old east, Kampfner praises the amount of money spent on trying to glue the two uneven parts of a country divided by war and superpower standoff back together and cheers the €2tn devoted to that endeavour. The successes are nicely evoked: we discover that Leipzig, the smog-laden city of the 1989 revolution, is so fashionable and popular for investors that it has been dubbed “Hypezig”.
Germany is placid, unshowy and diligent. It can also be smug
Yet the question that worries German policymakers is how vast the economic gap has remained. Its own annual Unity report flags up worrying gaps in pensions and earnings and how slowly these are closing, more so than was intended by the optimistic architects of reunification.
So, yes, Germany is placid, unshowy and diligent. It can also be smug, as underlined by the senior official whose analysis of populism is that “other countries have not learned the same lessons as we have”. In the shape of the AfD, Kampfner finds the resurgent far right peddling a “collection bowl of grievances” with a nasty racist edge to boot. Here is the paradox of German politics - the country that is lauded as the most consensual produces election results in which a large portion of the popular vote now goes to parties of the extreme right and left, and anti-vaxx and anti-mask demos happen on a large scale, even while the Covid-19 response is widely praised.
Being grown up means responsibility in the wider world and here the record is chequered. The laggardly approach to raising defence spending (the money matters less than the implied drift away from the western alliance), armed forces beset by interminable internal problems and a determination to plough on with the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project reflect a fragmented geopolitical outlook in Berlin. The price of the “grown up” – corporatism that powers the German economy – is also that a lot of dubious stuff gets swept under the carpet, as the saga of the car industry and the still unfolding emissions scandal shows.
So to Brexit, which, as Kampfner points out, has strained the “frenemy” relationship. Since 2016, it has not looked as if either side has much appetite to extend an olive branch and those of us who wince at the “you crazy Brits” preachiness must concur that there has been a breach in relations that urgently needs to be healed. Britain’s post-EU future will in no small part depend on rebuilding an affinity with the European powerhouse and rubbing along together in a fragmented world. Whether Brexiters like it or not, the heirs to Merkel will shape the next lurching chapter of our island story.

But if Angela Merkel cancels the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, Putin will take notice
Alexei Navalny, who lies critically ill in a German hospital after being poisoned in Siberia, is Russia’s unofficial leader of the opposition and the politician Vladimir Putin fears most. Relatively young, resourceful and smart, he has bravely defied many previous attempts to silence him, including imprisonment and physical attacks. Navalny is not easily dismissed as a pro-western dissident or leftwing intellectual. He is a Russian patriot, a daring, Jason Bourne-like figure who recently flew drones over the private dachas of the Kremlin elite to expose their apparently corruptly acquired wealth, then posted videos online.
That the Kremlin is responsible for Navalny’s plight is not in serious doubt. Whether Putin had prior knowledge of the plot, or personally authorised it, will probably never be known. As usual, the Kremlin is hiding behind a wall of denials and absurd claims, such as that Navalny fell ill after flying on an empty stomach. But his German doctors are unequivocal. He was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, novichok, which the Russian state secretly developed and which only Russia is known to have used.
Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries.
The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman.
Novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes.
The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol.
The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal  after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents.
Why choose this particular moment to assassinate a longstanding opponent? One possible reason is widespread political unrest in Russia’s far east, which Navalny tried to tap into before he was attacked. For a worried Kremlin, the pro-democracy uprising in neighbouring Belarus sets a dangerous precedent he could exploit. Another possible reason is the negative impact of the pandemic on Russia’s economy, which is in freefall, and on Putin’s personal standing.
The timing may also have been influenced by events further afield. Putin reportedly expects Donald Trump to be re-elected in November. According to US intelligence, he is doing his covert best to help him. But if Joe Biden wins, Putin’s easy ride will end. American tolerance for his anti-western subversion operations and malign meddling in places such as Ukraine, the Baltic republics, the Balkans and the Middle East will fall. The same goes for the regime’s internal repression and its egregious habit of killing or jailing critics.
Who attacked Navalny is not realistically in doubt. The bigger, unanswered question is what can the western democracies do about it? As after the Salisbury novichok poisonings, there has been a chorus of condemnation from just about everyone except Trump. As in 2018, sanctions and expulsions of Russian diplomats are mooted. Russia has been sternly told it must provide an explanation for breaching international law and the prohibition on using chemical weapons.
Putin reportedly expects Donald Trump to be re-elected. If Joe Biden wins, his easy ride will end
Yet those making such calls, including the EU, Nato, the UN and Britain, know perfectly well that Putin will do no such thing. If punitive measures are imposed, he will ride them out, as he did over Crimea. Contemptuously flouting western liberal opinion matters far more to him than any damage that may be done to Russia and its people.
But there is a way to hit him where it hurts and it’s in the hands of Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has been outspoken over the Navalny affair. As urged by Germany’s Greens and many in her ruling coalition, Merkel could and should scrap the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, if completed, will greatly enrich Putin and his larcenous henchmen. Cancellation could also reduce Russian leverage in Europe, sending a powerful message Putin could not ignore.
More important still, abandoning the pipeline would be an environmental boon. It’s crazy to be boosting gas capacity during a climate emergency, thereby increasing use of high-carbon fossil fuels. Merkel should perform a double U-turn: scrap Nord Stream 2 and lift her veto on nuclear power generation to assure Germany’s future energy supply. It’s asking a lot. But Merkel is nearing the end of her career and has political capital in the bank. To adapt her famous words in 2015: “Sie kann es schaffen” – she can manage it.

Germany is demanding answers from the Kremlin over the confirmed poisoning of the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, but is struggling to find methods to extract them that don’t involve a humiliating loss of face.
The assertive manner in which Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday that Navalny, who is lying in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital, had been targeted with a nerve agent from the novichok group raised eyebrows, and not just in the German capital.
Stepping out in front of the press in person, the chancellor described the “attempted murder by poisoning” as “an attack on the fundamental values and basic rights to which we are committed”.
Her foreign and defence ministers reiterated the message on camera: three of the most senior figures in Merkel’s cabinet made themselves personally accountable, knowing the rest of their careers could be judged on whether they will follow up words with actions.
The tone was even more surprising because many felt Germany had soft-pedalled last year after the murder of a Chechen dissident in a park in central Berlin, at the hands of what federal prosecutors believe was an assassin hired by the Russian state: an incident on paper more severe than Navalny’s, who ended up in Berlin for treatment almost by accident, at the request of his friends and relatives.
For years, we have misunderstood the game of chess that the Kremlin has been playing with us, and now we cannot pull the sanction strings any tighter without garrotting ourselves
In the case of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, or the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018, there were suspects whose movements could be traced back to Russia. With Navalny, there were only traces of the rare nerve agent, which western intelligence agencies believe to be a sole prerogative of the Russian state.
Instead, German exasperation over the novichok find is also an expression of a broader disillusionment with its own “special relationship” with Russia. “Germany’s diplomatic approach to Russia has run out of road this week,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who sits on the foreign affairs committee of the Bundestag.
“For years, we have misunderstood the game of chess that the Kremlin has been playing with us,” Kiesewetter told the Observer. “And now we cannot pull the sanction strings any tighter without garrotting ourselves.”
In the postwar period, German diplomacy towards Russia has tried – and often struggled – to reconcile a tough stance over security or human rights with a friendly dialogue that pays respect to a joint history of bloody wars and shared cultural memories.
The question of which of these strands to prioritise cuts across traditional party lines, not just between east and west but also north and south, with the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s CDU, the CSU, openly in favour of relaxing sanctions against Russia.
“Germany has traditionally pursued a twin-pillar strategy with Russia: on the one hand confrontation, on the other hand strategic selective engagement,” said Fabian Burkhardt, a political scientist at the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies in Regensburg.
“But the use of a chemical nerve agent against a political opponent has genuinely shaken the second pillar. Merkel’s reaction on Wednesday spoke of a deep-seated frustration that has built up over the years. At the moment it is hard to see where the common basis for a strategic engagement could be.”
Merkel’s own approach during her 15 years in power, while decidedly sceptical towards Vladimir Putin’s Russia, was never openly aggressive. The Nord Stream 2 project, a twin pipeline running from the Narva Bay in Russia to the German town of Lubmin, was carried over from her Social Democrat predecessor Gerhard Schröder in spite of criticism from the US, the European commission and EU member states in eastern Europe and the Baltics.
As recently as Tuesday Merkel insisted that the €9.5bn project, which is 94% finished, was still on course to be completed. Party allies argue that the commitment to phase out nuclear and coal, coupled with the slow build-up of power transmission routes from the windy north to the country’s south, has made the import of Russian natural gas indispensable.
In the wake of the Navalny poisoning, however, a U-turn on the profitable project may be Merkel’s only way to hit Putin “where it hurts”, as the news weekly Der Spiegel wrote. Political voices calling for a moratorium on the project, mainly from the Green party, but also from the pro-business Free Democrats and Merkel’s own CDU, have grown in volume.
Berlin has not asked for [sanctions] and the location of the poisoning, on Russian territory, makes it different to the incident in Salisbury
The pipeline, which is owned by the Kremlin-controlled Gazprom, “indirectly finances a regime that does not shy away from using banned weapons of mass destruction”, Annalena Baerbock, the Greens’ co-leader, said on Friday.
With work on the pipeline on hold after construction companies withdrew under threat of US sanctions, critics say the time to stop the project has never been better: pulling the plug could be presented as a decisive political act rather than being cowed by American threats.
Penalties for breach of contract, estimated by the European Commission in 2017 to be as high as €800m, would pale in comparison with the multibillion-euro pandemic rescue funds.
Some economists also question whether Germany really needs the pipeline to keep its lights on at all. “Demand for natural gas in Germany has always been lower than forecast in the last 10 years and will decline in the future” says Claudia Kemfert of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW).
Europe, she argues, could maintain its natural gas use almost at the same level even if Russia ended its deliveries completely, by shipping in more liquefied natural gas from the Middle East, west Africa or America.
In Merkel’s chancellory such calculations will be studied with close interest in the coming weeks, even as Berlin publicly calls for a joint European rather than a unilateral German response to the Navalny case.
So far, the EU as a whole has condemned “in the strongest possible terms the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny” but there has been limited pressure within the bloc for sanctions.
Despite the insistence of Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, that such a move has not been ruled out there remains little appetite for it among the larger member states.
“The Baltic states wanted them, of course, but Berlin has not asked for it and the location of the poisoning, on Russian territory, makes it different to the incident in Salisbury,” said one EU diplomat in Brussels.
The incident has, however, thwarted what appeared to be a concerted attempt by the French president Emmanuel Macron to build bridges with the Kremlin. Plans for a visit by Macron to Moscow later this month along with a summit of foreign and defence ministers from the two countries are now in doubt.
A meeting in September 2019 in Moscow had opened a “strategic dialogue” called for by Macron, in a move that surprised European partners. “It was ill advised anyway and this has shown why,” said an EU source.

But what will they do?
Outrageous and reprehensible, certainly. The international reaction to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, got that much right. But Germany’s description of the act as “astounding” was less apt. Few were surprised when Berlin confirmed on Wednesday that a nerve agent from the Novichok family had been used, tying the attack firmly to the highest levels of the Russian state, though Moscow has denied involvement. Mr Navalny is being treated in Germany and remains gravely ill.
The question is what follows the condemnation. The wife of the British policeman who almost died after investigating the 2018 Salisbury poisonings gave a tart response to Boris Johnson’s denunciation: “Actions speak louder than words.” The attack on defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia – which led to the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess – stirred the west to concerted diplomatic action, with 20 countries carrying out a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats alleged to be spies. But it had little discernible effect, and with fewer foreign diplomats left in Moscow, countries are more reluctant to lose them to tit-for-tat expulsions.
Angela Merkel was unusually vocal in her condemnation on Wednesday, saying the attack was, beyond doubt, attempted murder, which posed “very serious questions that only the Russian government can answer – and must answer”. But she was also adamant that Germany will press ahead with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which could double the amount of gas brought into Europe from Russia.
Mr Navalny had suggested action to rein in Russia should target those with close links to Mr Putin, including in London. In the UK, Magnitsky-style legislation and unexplained wealth orders give the government new options. It shows little interest. The long-delayed Russia report, finally released in July, found that British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. The Conservative party has received more than £3m from wealthy Soviet-born donors, many of them with close ties to Mr Putin, and a Brexit government wants to maximise foreign investment.
To no one’s surprise, though the White House has condemned the poisoning, Donald Trump has barely deigned to acknowledge it. The US president was unhappy at the extent of the 2018 expulsions. He has yet to challenge Vladimir Putin over intelligence reports that Russia paid bounties to the Taliban for fatal attacks on US troops in Afghanistan. He suggested the Russian president’s denials of election meddling in 2016 bore more weight than US intelligence assessments, and dismisses the reports that Kremlin-backed groups are trying to interfere in November’s election on his behalf.
While many have suggested that the attack on Mr Navalny may have been sparked by Moscow’s anxieties about the uprising in Belarus, and the protests in the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, some have also wondered whether the prospect of a Biden administration might have prompted action sooner rather than later. What is certain is that while the Kremlin faces little or no cost for interfering in foreign democracies, and not much more for endangering foreign citizens with attacks on foreign soil, it will be confident that it can act with impunity within its own borders. Others cannot claim to be surprised by the results."

Angela Merkel is under growing domestic pressure to end her support for the joint German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline project over the confirmed poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
The German Green party called on the chancellor to use the nearly completed infrastructure project to press the Kremlin into answering allegations over what Merkel called the “silencing” of Navalny with a novichok nerve agent.
“This openly attempted murder through the Kremlin’s mafia-like structures should not just worry us but needs to have real consequences,” said Katrin Göring-Eckardt, the co-chair of the Greens in the Bundestag.
“Nord Stream 2 is no longer something we can jointly pursue with Russia,” said the politician for the ecological party, currently second in polls to Merkel’s CDU and a likely contender for the next coalition government.
Russia insisted there was no reason for the west to accuse it over Navalny and said any response from Germany or other countries would be premature. The Kremlin claimed hospital tests carried out on Navalny inside Russia before he was flown to Berlin found nothing suspicious.
“There are no grounds to accuse the Russian state. And we are not inclined to accept any accusations in this respect,” Vladimir Putin’s press spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said.
Instead, senior Russian figures offered their own counter-explanations for Navalny’s illness. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Moscow’s foreign intelligence service, said western intelligence agencies were to blame. Andrei Lugovoi – who was charged by the UK with poisoning Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 with radioactive tea– accused Berlin. The Germans had contaminated Navalny with novichok, he said.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Moscow to cooperate with an international probe into the poisoning and said the 27-nation bloc would not rule out sanctions. Brussels “reserves the right to take appropriate actions, including through restrictive measures”, Borrell said in a statement.
Calls to permanently halt the construction of the two 764-mile (1,230km) pipelines beneath the Baltic Sea, from the Narva Bay in Russia to the German town of Lubmin, were echoed within the German chancellor’s own party.
Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the Bundestag’s committee on foreign affairs and a candidate for the CDU leadership, told German media on Wednesday that completing the joint project would amount to encouraging Putin’s “inhuman and contemptuous politics”.
“After the poisoning of Navalny we need a strong European answer, which Putin understands,” Röttgen said. “The EU should jointly decide to stop Nord Stream 2.”
The tabloid newspaper Bild also called for a change of mind from the chancellor, who as recently as Tuesday reiterated her government’s intention to complete the multibillion-euro infrastructure project.
“The government can condemn the poisoning of Putin critic Navalny ‘in the strongest terms possible’,” said a Bild editorial on Thursday. “It can show its ‘dismay’. It can ‘urgently’ call on the Kremlin to explain itself. But as long as it acts in collusion with Putin on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, all these declarations are just empty words”.
Not just the US, but also states in eastern Europe and the Baltics have repeatedly expressed concerns about the pipeline since the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder approved its construction in 2005, saying it will increase Putin’s geopolitical influence.
The Nord Stream 2 twin pipeline is nearly finished, with only about 160 out of a planned 1,220km (760 miles) remaining.
However, the construction of the gas project has been on halt since late December last year, when the Swiss pipeline manufacturer Allseas ceased its work after threats of targeted US sanctions.
The German utility firm Uniper, one of Gazprom’s five financial partners in the project, last month conceded there was an increasing possibility the pipeline would never be completed.
Though set into motion by Merkel’s centre-left predecessor shortly before the start of her tenure, the construction project is of vital economic importance for the country because Germany is likely to need more imported gas in the future – and particularly for the chancellor’s own constituency in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung commented on Thursday that Merkel’s strong condemnation of Navalny’s poisoning would make it harder to square the circle of her support for the joint project.
“The government waved goodbye to a fiction on Wednesday,” the newspaper’s correspondent Daniel Brössler commented. “A fiction that made it possible to slap Russia with sanctions one day and court it as a business partner the next.”
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said Navalny’s poisoning was a matter of grave concern. It said the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances was reprehensible and “wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community”.
In April 2018 undercover officers from Russia’s GRU military spy agency tried to hack the OPCW, which is based in The Hague. They were arrested in a car park opposite the building. The mission took place shortly after the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal by two GRU assassins.
The OPCW said it was monitoring the Navalny situation and was ready to engage with any state that needed its help.

Why won't Britain do the same?";"The Kurzarbeit part-time working scheme is criticised as expensive – but it has protected German jobs and skills
Alongside Zoom, Netflix and Amazon, Germanophilia has to be counted as one of the prime victors of the pandemic that has so thoroughly remade the world this year. It isn’t hard to see why: for every collapse of Anglo-American leadership, there seems to have been a German counter-example. From testing to lockdowns, contact tracing to hospital beds, Germany has thrived where Britain has floundered. Most recently, the decision of Merkel’s coalition government to extend the popular furlough scheme known as Kurzarbeit (literally, “short work”), is being greeted by many as another example of Teutonic good sense.
The Kurzarbeit programme, in which the government provides workers whose hours have been reduced with a minimum of 60% of their lost pay, has been credited by many with softening the economic blow of the pandemic. Shekhar Aiyar, the IMF’s mission chief for Germany, praised the programme lavishly in an interview, claiming that Germany, by expanding the scope of the scheme and making it more flexible, “is doing precisely what should be done in deep recessions”. Dominic Rushe attributes a substantial portion of the difference between the US unemployment crisis and Germany’s moderate bump in jobless numbers to Kurzarbeit, while the Economist claims that for many experts, “the model for a Covid-19 furlough scheme has been Germany’s”.
The scheme wasn’t built in a day. It first emerged in the early 20th century, when it was instituted as a means of softening the mass unemployment that followed the first world war in Germany – in 1924, nearly a quarter of all Germans were on Kurzarbeit, while another 11% were unemployed. The same system was largely adapted by West Germany after the war, and it helped to soften unemployment during recessions in 1967, 1975, and 1983. Beyond the obvious benefit of reducing unemployment, the scheme is particularly adept at ensuring that highly trained workers can continue to use their skills despite recessions. Thomas Fuster, writing in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, claims that it is “no coincidence that Kurzarbeit is most commonly found in countries where on-the job training is especially important”. Companies that invest heavily in their employees are more heavily motivated to invest in their retention. Companies – and countries – whose economies rely largely on unskilled labour are more comfortable with unstable labour markets.
The scheme is not without its problems. There are, of course, concerns about the costs. Christian von Stetten of Merkel’s CDU complained that the programme would constitute a “sabbatical at taxpayers’ expense”, while Katja Suding, a politician from the liberal FDP, claimed that it amounted to “burning taxpayers’ money”. These claims are often coupled with the argument that the system merely delays the loss of jobs, rather than preventing them. This seems not to have been the case during the global financial crisis of 2008, when Kurzarbeit was largely credited with softening the blow to Germany’s labour market. Yet there are substantial concerns that the scheme could help prop up companies, or even entire industries, that should properly be contracting. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung warned in 2019 that the German auto industry, which was already struggling with a bad export market prior to the pandemic, should not be propped up with Kurzarbeit indefinitely. Now – after profiting from a massive bailout in 2008 – German automakers continue to rely on government subsidies thanks to the programme.
There are also substantial concerns that the system is rife for abuse – companies can easily claim that their workers are spending fewer hours on the job, while business goes on as usual. Yet the number of such cases seems to be limited. Currently, there are just 900 cases under investigation, while 880,000 companies have claimed Kurzarbeit during the pandemic. A more substantial problem has to do with the nature of the scheme itself. It’s easy to tell whether a factory worker is working less than a full day. It’s very hard to tell whether a computer programmer, lawyer or graphic designer has finished their work in six hours or eight, particularly when everyone is working from home. In one columnist’s view, newspapers that sent their entire editorial staff into Kurzarbeit risk defrauding taxpayers, given that the competitive culture that had long thrived in journalism prior to the pandemic makes it virtually impossible to imagine that editors are in fact working part time.
For all of these problems, the decision to extend coronavirus Kurzarbeit protections has been widely praised in Germany. It’s not hard to see why. As serious as these issues might be, they pale in comparison to the kind of mass unemployment the US is currently experiencing, and investing in the retention of highly qualified workers now may prop up some failing industries, but it will also help others to stay competitive through an unprecedented global crisis. The question, really, isn’t why the Germans are extending their programme; given the widespread acclaim for it among both trade unions and economists, the question is much more why Britain is still resisting extending its own furlough programme.

The father of the woman who died in the Wiltshire nerve agent poisonings said he hoped the novichok attack on the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny would lead to fresh scrutiny of Moscow, adding that he believed Germany might work harder to get answers than the UK had done since the death of his daughter.
Stan Sturgess, father of Dawn, who died in July 2018, said he felt Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, would ask more searching questions than did Boris Johnson following the novichok poisonings in Salisbury. Johnson was the foreign secretary at the time of the Wiltshire poisonings.
He added that the revelations from the German government that it believed Navalny, who is being treated in Berlin, had been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent had brought back awful memories.
Sturgess said he was not surprised to learn novichok apparently had been used again. “As soon as I heard Navalny had been poisoned I thought it was novichok. It’s the Russians’ calling card. The Russians want everyone to know it’s them. We always said it could happen again.”
Sturgess said: “At least Angela Merkel may ask more questions than Boris Johnson was ever going to ask. Maybe more pressure will be put on the Russians now. Boris never asked anything. We may get some more answers. I don’t know if we’ll get justice but everything opens the door a bit more.
“It brings back terrible memories, it churns it all up again. It’s scary times for anyone who goes against the Russians.”
Dawn Sturgess’s partner, Charlie Rowley, who is still recovering from the effects of novichok poisoning, said: “They’ve done it once and got away with it and they can do it again and they feel they can get away with it with no come-back.” Rowley suffers from eye problems, shortness of breath and mental health issues, which he blames on his exposure to novichok.
Rowley suggested the evidence continued to grow against Russia. “It comes across more and more that it leads back to Russia. Because it’s happened again, you don’t know when it’s going to stop, or if it’s going to stop.”
Rowley said he was angry. “I want to find out what happened. I’m upset it’s happened again but I hope we get some results this time. I’d like questions to be answered and I hope this time around whoever is in charge will push forward and try to get some answers. I hope they get to the bottom of it.”
The wife of Nick Bailey, the police officer who almost died after investigating the 2018 poisonings, said there had been no justice for the victims of the Salisbury attack including for her husband and Dawn Sturgess’ family. Replying to a tweet from the prime minister in which he condemned the attack on Navalny, Sarah Bailey said: “Actions speak louder than words.”
The former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with novichok in March 2018. Nick Bailey was contaminated after going into Skripal’s house after the attack. The three survived after lengthy spells in hospital.
At the end of June 2018, Sturgess and her partner, Rowley, were poisoned by novichok in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, after he found a fake perfume bottle that turned out to contain the nerve agent. Rowley survived but Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July 2018.
The two men suspected of bringing the novichok to Salisbury, Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga, colonels in Russia’s GRU military spy agency, have been charged in absentia over the poisoning of the Skripals, but it is highly unlikely the men will ever be brought before a court in the UK.
Both Bailey and his wife replied via Twitter to a post from Johnson in which the prime minister said the attack against Navalny was “outrageous”.
“The Russian government must now explain what happened,” he added.
It’s outrageous that a chemical weapon was used against Alexey Navalny. We have seen first-hand the deadly consequences of Novichok in the UK. The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny – we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done.
Bailey responded: “I have so much that I want to say about this tweet. But I can’t, and I won’t.”
I have so much that I want to say about this tweet. But I can’t, and I won’t. https://t.co/1ZzDzl5WKa
Sarah Bailey said: “Justice would be nice. Actions speak louder than words,” before adding that there’s been no justice for the Sturgesses and Skripals in the two and a half years since the attacks, and “now it’s happened again”.
Justice would be nice. Actions speak louder than words. #nevergoingtohappen https://t.co/KbM0xomPZb
There appears to be no consequences for the culprits. The Government are right to condemn these actions, but in 2 1/2 years will it be forgotten about? That’s how it feels for us. #RIPDawn

World leaders are demanding answers from the Kremlin after toxicological examinations indicated that the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent from the novichok family.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, revealed that tests carried out at a military laboratory had “identified unequivocally” the Soviet era nerve agent. She referred to the case as an “attempted murder” and said the findings raised “very difficult questions that only the Russian government can answer, and has to answer”.
The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, called the findings “outrageous” and said: “The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny.”
The White House called the attack “completely reprehensible”. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called it an “outrageous and brazen attempt on Mr Navalny’s life” and noted that Donald Trump had yet to personally condemn the attack.
Navalny, whose foundation publishes investigations into corruption among high-level officials in Russia, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on 20 August and was transferred to Berlin two days later.
Doctors who treated him in the Siberian city of Omsk, where his flight made an emergency landing, insisted there was no proof of poisoning and were initially reluctant to allow him to leave the country on a specially equipped plane.
The discovery that novichok was used on Navalny will lead many to conclude that the attack was meant as a brazen message to critics of the Kremlin, and Navalny’s associates quickly pointed the finger at Putin.
“Choosing novichok to poison Navalny in 2020 is basically the same thing as leaving an autograph at the scene of the crime,” wrote Navalny’s associate Leonid Volkov on Twitter, appending an image of Putin’s autograph to the tweet.
Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation, wrote that it was “beyond any reasonable doubt” that only Russian security services would be able to use novichok.
Born in 1976 just outside Moscow, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer-turned-campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation investigates the wealth of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.
He started out as a Russian nationalist, but emerged as the main leader of Russia's democratic opposition during the wave of protests that led up to the 2012 presidential election, and has since been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side.
Navalny is barred from appearing on state television, but has used social media to his advantage. A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months.
He has been repeatedly arrested and jailed. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014. Election officials barred him from running for president in 2018 due to an embezzlement conviction that he claims was politically motivated. Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote 'not against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me; against 200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me'.
There has also been a physical price to pay. In April 2017, he was attacked with green dye that nearly blinded him in one eye, and in July 2019 he was taken from jail to hospital with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate poisoning. In 2020, he was again hospitalised after a suspected poisoning, and taken to Germany for treatment. The German government later said toxicology results showed Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent.
The nerve agent was used to poison the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain two years ago. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at Berlin’s Charité hospital initially identified in Navalny.
According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, experts at the Charité sought advice from Porton Down, Britain’s secretive laboratory for research on chemical and biological weapons, because of possible similarities with the 2018 Skripal attack.
The use of novichok nerve agents was banned last year after being added to the chemical weapons convention’s list of controlled substances.
The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “The Russian government has a clear case to answer. It is absolutely unacceptable that this banned chemical weapon has been used again, and once more we see violence directed against a leading Russian opposition figure.”
The US National Security Council noted that Russia had used novichok “in the past”, and said the US would “work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities.”
The German government’s official statement described the attack on Navalny as an “astounding act” and appealed to the Russian government to urgently offer an explanation.
Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries.
The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman.
Novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes.
The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol.
The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal  after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents.
“We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms”, said the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, adding that the Russian ambassador in Berlin had been summoned in light of the new findings.
Official reaction in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon was a mixture of denial and obfuscation. The Kremlin said it had not yet been informed of the findings, while some other officials suggested Russia was willing to work with German investigators, but attempted to cast doubt on the test results.
“The Russian side is still expecting an official answer from Berlin to the inquiry from the Russian prosecutor general’s office and Russian medical institutions,” said the foreign ministry in a statement.
The Russian doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia have repeatedly contested the German hospital’s conclusion, saying they ruled out poisoning as a diagnosis and that their tests for poisonous substances came back negative.
“We will demand that the Germans send their analyses so we can compare with our data and work out what really happened,” Vladimir Dzhabarov, of Russia’s upper house of parliament, told Interfax. “We are ready to cooperate. The main thing is whether they are. Because ideally they should have invited us and familiarised our investigation team with their materials.”
Merkel’s spokesperson Steffen Seibert said the German government would inform its partners in the EU and Nato about the test results. He said it would consult with its partners on appropriate next steps in light of any Russian response.
In the wake of the killing of a Chechen dissident in a central Berlin park last August, the German government was initially cautious to blame the Kremlin, even after federal prosecutors alleged that Russian state agencies had tasked the assassin.
The language of the German government’s statement on the Navalny affair could prompt a more decisive response. Merkel said on Wednesday that the poison attack went “against the basic values we stand for”.
Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP and former fellow student of Navalny’s at Yale University, said: “I’m impressed by the clear framing of the government’s response. The confirmation that a banned nerve agent was used to poison a Russian opposition politician brings this case on to an international level. We need an international investigation.”
Whether the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the capacity to carry out such an investigation remains unclear.
On Tuesday, before the use of novichok was confirmed, Merkel had again confirmed that her government would continue and finish the construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in spite of pressure from the US government.
The infrastructure project, which eastern European states fear will boost Russia’s geopolitical power, plays an important role in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, home to Merkel’s own constituency.
Navalny is being kept in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator at the intensive care unit of the Charité hospital. While his condition remains serious, a spokesperson said last Friday there was no immediate danger to his life.

Mohammad Hallak found the key to unlock the mysteries of his new homeland when he realised you could switch the subtitles on your Netflix account to German. The 21-year-old Syrian from Aleppo jotted down words he didn’t know, increased his vocabulary and quickly became fluent. Last year, he passed his end of high school exams with a grade of 1.5, the top mark in his year group.
Five years to the month after arriving in Germany as an unaccompanied minor, Hallak is now in his third term studying computer science at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences and harbours an aspiration to become an IT entrepreneur. “Germany was always my goal”, he says, in the mumbled sing-song of the Ruhr valley dialect. “I’ve always had a funny feeling that I belong here.”
Hallak, an exceptionally motivated student with high social aptitude, is not representative of all the 1.7 million people who applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2019, making it the country with the fifth highest population of refugees in the world. Some of those with whom he trekked through Turkey and across the Mediterranean, he says, haven’t picked up more than a few words and “just chill”.
But Hallak is not a complete outlier either. More than 10,000 people who arrived in Germany as refugees since 2015 have mastered the language sufficiently to enrol at a German university. More than half of those who came are in work and pay taxes. Among refugee children and teenagers, more than 80% say they have a strong sense of belonging to their German schools and feel liked by their peers.
Success stories like Hallak’s partially redeem the optimism expressed by Angela Merkel in a sentence she spoke five years ago this week, at the peak of one of the most tumultuous years in recent European history – a sentence that nearly cost her her job and that she herself has partially retreated from.
“I put it simply, Germany is a strong country,” the German chancellor told the media at a press conference in central Berlin on 31 August 2015, trying to address concerns about the steeply rising number of people – mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan – applying for asylum in Germany that summer.
“The motive with which we approach these matters must be: we have already managed so much, we’ll manage this.” During the German TV broadcast of her interview, headlines flashed up to report that Hungary was sending trainloads of people to the German border, 20,000 of whom turned up at Munich central station the following week alone.
The German phrase Merkel used, Wir schaffen das, became so memorable mainly because it would in the weeks and months that followed be endlessly quoted back at her by those who believed that the German chancellor’s optimistic message had encouraged millions more migrants to embark on a dangerous odyssey across the Med. “Merkel’s actions, now, will be hard to correct: her words cannot be unsaid,” wrote the Spectator. “She has exacerbated a problem that will be with us for years, perhaps decades.”
The Alternative für Deutschland party, founded two years previously on a more narrowly anti-euro ticket, discovered a new populist stride: when Merkel said “We will manage”, the rightwing party claimed, she really meant “You will manage”, asking the German public to cope with rising levels of crime, terrorism and public disorder.
“We don’t want to manage this!” the AfD politician Alexander Gauland proclaimed at a party rally in October 2015. Over the coming months and years – in the wake of the New Year’s Eve sexual assaults in Cologne, the Bataclan terror attack in Paris and the truck rampage on Berlin’s Breitscheidtplatz Christmas market – that sentiment seemed to gain traction with a growing part of the German population, even when the crimes were not carried out by people who had arrived in 2015.
By 2017, there was a prevalent view that Wir schaffen das would be Merkel’s undoing, a “catastrophic mistake” as Donald Trump said in January that year. “The worst decision a European leader has made in modern times,” Nigel Farage told Fox News. “She’s finished.”
Yet today Merkel still sits at the top of Europe’s largest economy, her personal approval ratings back to where they were at the start of 2015 and the polling of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), buoyed to record levels by the global pandemic. When Merkel steps down ahead of federal elections in 2021, as is expected, her party’s successor currently looks more likely to be a centrist in her mould than a hardliner promising a symbolic break with her stance on immigration.
The question is what could she have done differently? You can’t seal a wide-open border with rhetoric and a few guards
The AfD, meanwhile, never reached the point “when it will be the country’s second-largest party”, as historian Niall Ferguson predicted in February 2018. The party has established a steady presence in local parliaments across Germany, especially in the states of the formerly socialist east. But at federal level the AfD has dropped to fourth in the polls, down from its third place and 12.6% at elections in 2017, and has been stricken with infighting since immigration has dropped off the top of the political agenda.
The spectre of jihadist terrorism, which some feared the refugee crisis would usher into the heart of central Europe, has faded from view in recent years. After a spate of seven attacks with an Islamist motive in Germany in 2016, culminating with a truck driven into a Berlin Christmas market that December, the country has seen no further attacks for the last three years.
Peter Neumann, a terrorism expert at King’s College London’s Department of War Studies, recalls being invited onto a German TV programme at the height of the crisis in 2015. “I gave my optimistic best back then, but deep down I was worried,” he says. “Will this work out? With nearly a million people about whom we know so little? In the end, those fears were misplaced.
“We know that some of the men involved in the Bataclan attack had exploited the chaos to smuggle themselves into Europe, in some cases posing as Syrian refugees. We also knew that the vast majority of people who arrived were young men, the very demographic that is most susceptible to radicalisation. And yet, we can now say that the worst fears haven’t come true.
“In hindsight, Isis’s collapse happened quicker than we expected. It’s now clear that what made them so attractive for a while is less their ideology than their success. And when Isis stopped being successful, it stopped being attractive.”
However, Neumann says this was also due to the increasing efficiency of German intelligence agencies. According to data collected by Petter Nesser, a senior research fellow with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, 16 terror plots with a jihadist motive have been foiled on German soil since the start of 2015, more than in France or the UK over the same period.
The events of the summer of 2015 did evidently mobilise and further radicalise Germany’s rightwing extremist circles, who targeted asylum shelters with arson attacks or assassinated politicians with pro-immigration views, such as the CDU’s Walter Lübcke. No other country in Europe saw as much severe and fatal rightwing violence in 2019 as Germany.
Germany’s Federal Office of Criminal Investigations records a rise of criminal offences, including violent crime, in the years between 2014 and 2016, linking the trend to the influx of migration. The percentage of asylum seekers found guilty of such crimes also doubled in the same period. However, the majority of these offences were within the refugee shelters where new arrivals were initially housed. By 2017, when Trump claimed that “crime in Germany is way up” because it had taken in “all of those illegals”, the number of overall recorded crimes was decreasing. Last year, crime in Germany sank to an 18-year low.
What about the organised crime on Europe’s borders, where human traffickers prey on those willing to risk it all in the hope of a better life? In a 2017 book on reforming asylum policy, British economist Paul Collier argued that “while the industry was already well-established in the Mediterranean, the massive rise in demand triggered by the invitation from Germany further increased demand for smuggling by criminal syndicates.”
Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a thinktank that advises EU member-states on migration policy, disagrees vehemently: “The thesis that Merkel created the refugee crisis was absurd in 2015, and it’s even more absurd in retrospect,” he says.
Empirical studies have failed to find data proving that Merkel’s Wir schaffen das significantly intensified the movement of refugees into Europe, although it is likely that the attention drawn towards Germany’s liberal stance on asylum influenced the decisions of those who were already in Europe at the time.
“The question is: what could she have done differently?” says Knaus. “Reintroduce borders and try what France did after the Bataclan attacks in November 2015, sending all irregular migrants back to Italy? That proved futile: France received twice as many asylum applications in 2019 as in 2015. You can’t seal a wide-open border with rhetoric and a few more border guards, while brutality was fortunately ruled out in Germany.”
Germany’s stance in 2015 did prove too optimistic in the sense that Merkel’s government seemed to believe that the tumultuous events of that summer would lead to a quick reform of the Dublin Regulation, the mechanism that determines which state is responsible for examining an asylum application. Knaus says: “The Germans thought everyone would sign up to a quota system because it was ‘fair’, but they couldn’t explain how this would work in practice.”
Instead, Merkel’s government took unilateral steps to slow down the rate of new arrivals to a trickle. An agreement between Turkey and the EU to stop irregular migration and replace it with a resettlement scheme, developed by Knaus’s thinktank, drastically stemmed the flow of migrants to Europe in 2016. Merkel’s government later tried to limit asylum applications from north Africa by adding Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to its list of countries considered safe, though the proposal was later rejected by the upper chamber of Germany’s parliament.
In March this year, Germany launched a social media campaign to deter Syrian refugees from embarking on a journey to central Europe, and Merkel’s “grand coalition” with the centre-left Social Democratic party voted against taking in even just 5,000 vulnerable refugees stranded in Greek camps.
Merkel never recanted her words of August 2015, as many even in her own party insisted she should. But she did ensure a situation like the one that followed won’t be repeated on German soil during her tenure.
On a sweltering afternoon in Berlin’s suburban south, preparations are afoot for the annual summer fete at the Marienfelde transit centre, a sprawling concrete camp that used to be the first port of call for many East Germans who fled to the west during the cold war, and now houses asylum seekers from around the world. While volunteers erect socially distanced benches and hang up garlands in the courtyard, a group of men and women from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq have gathered inside to meet the Berlin senate’s integration officer, to ask for advice and air grievances.
A 44-year-old Syrian is concerned that he might fail next month’s language exam, even though he will need a pass in order to start working. German classes have been cancelled because of the pandemic, and the wireless signal inside the camp is too weak for online learning. “Berlin, on our doorstep, that is Europe,” says the man, who doesn’t want to give his name for fear of getting into trouble with the Syrian embassy. “But this shelter is like a little Syria: everyone speaks Arabic.”
Germany was not the destination of choice for the father of three, who arrived in the country via the resettlement programme of the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UNHCR, in 2018. He is grateful that Merkel’s government took him in, but the wait for a work permit is starting to exasperate him. Before Berlin, he worked for six years as a pastry chef in Izmit, Turkey, but German bakers won’t accept his qualifications – he would need to do another two-year apprenticeship first. “It’s very frustrating.”
It’s a success story even if no one quite has the confidence to say it yet. Germany has managed
The integration officer assures him she empathises with his plight: Katarina Niewiedzial, who has been in the post since 2019, was once a migrant herself, having arrived in Germany from Poland as a 12-year-old. She knows from personal experience the areas of public life where Germany is ill-equipped for the task of integrating newcomers.
German employers are often still reluctant to recognise foreign qualifications. If migrants lack the certificates to prove they are qualified enough to do a job, they can apply to prove their skills in an interview, but they need fluent German to do so – a bigger challenge for adults in their 40s than teenagers like Hallak. Last year, the German Chamber of Commerce only carried out 80 such “qualification analysis” processes in the whole of Germany.
Often refugees end up in jobs they are overqualified for, such as catering, which in turn are more precarious and have cut staff during the pandemic: in May this year, the number of unemployed Berliners without a German passport was up by 40% compared to the same period in 2019.
Many experts think that the integration classes that have been mandatory for refugees in Germany since 2005 are no longer fit for purpose, holding back those with academic qualifications while failing to offer real help for those who arrive without being able to read or write. The percentage of those failing the all-important B1 language test has risen rather than fallen over the last five years. And yet, Niewiedzial is optimistic. “Germany can be a very sluggish country, full of tiresome bureaucracy,” she says. “But it’s also able to learn from its mistakes and draw consequences from them.”
Since 2015, she says, the state had massively expanded its asylum authority, created thousands of posts to coordinate volunteers, turned shelters into permanent homes and trained specialist teachers. Germany has managed. “It’s a success story, even if no one quite has the confidence to say that yet.”
27 August 2015 71 migrants are found dead inside a refrigerated lorry abandoned in Austria. The discovery sparks international revulsion, and contributes to the decisions of several countries to open their borders to people fleeing war and poverty.
31 August 2015 Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, says Wir schaffen das – We’ll manage this – after visiting a camp for newly arrived refugees. Soon after she announces an open-door policy; in the year that follows over a million people claim asylum in Germany.
13 November 2015 The Bataclan attack in Paris is the first of a series of deadly attacks by Isis-affiliated extremists across Europe. In July 2016 a Syrian who declared his support for the group kills himself and injures 15 others with a homemade bomb at a music festival in the German town of Ansbach. The far right uses the attacks to argue against Merkel’s refugee policies.
March 2016 The EU strikes a deal with Turkey to return all refugees and migrants who reach Europe across the Aegean sea. This dramatically reduces the number of people arriving in Germany and other European countries to claim asylum.
19 September 2016 Merkel’s CDU party suffers a slump in support to just 18% in Berlin state elections, while anti-immigration populists Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) enters the German capital’s state parliament for the first time. Mayor Michael Müller warns that the level of support it won “would be seen around the world as a sign of the return of the rightwing and the Nazis in Germany”.
19 December 2016 A Tunisian whose asylum application had been turned down rams a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and wounding 70. Isis claims it inspired the attack.
24 September 2017 The populist radical-right AfD party enters the Bundestag, the German parliament, as the third biggest party. After Merkel forms a coalition with the Social Democrats, it becomes the largest opposition party.
October 2018 After crushing defeats in local elections, Merkel says she will step down as CDU leader almost immediately, and will not contest the 2021 elections, making her fourth term as Germany’s chancellor her last.
2020 Merkel’s effective handling of the coronavirus crisis helps restore her popularity, particularly as the US and UK stumble. One poll finds over 80% of Germans think she is doing her job “rather well”.

Germany’s plans to airlift the Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny to Berlin for treatment are being orchestrated by a charitable foundation acting with the explicit blessing of the federal government.
Jaka Bizilj, the Slovenian-born promoter and producer who founded Cinema for Peace in 2002, said his organisation was financing the flight and medical aid through private donors.
The foundation is supported by a group of philanthropists who give aid to humanitarian projects, in particular filmmakers who highlight global social challenges. It hosts an annual awards ceremony for films focusing on political and societal causes, which runs parallel to the Berlin film festival. Previous speakers at its awards gala have included Elton John, George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Russian president.
Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition activist, is in a coma in the Siberian city of Omsk after collapsing during a flight to Moscow on Thursday, allegedly from poisoning.
Bizilj’s involvement in the proposed airlift to Germany came about after Pyotr Verzilov, a member of the Russian political punk group Pussy Riot, intervened. Verzilov was himself flown from Moscow to Berlin by Cinema for Peace two years ago, after another suspected poisoning.
Verzilov, who had been treated at Berlin’s Charité university hospital, approached Bizilj on behalf of Navalny’s family this week. Bizilj told the newspaper Bild: “On the request of Pyotr Verzilov, for humanitarian reasons, we organised an aeroplane equipped with necessary medical supplies, so that Navalny can be brought to Germany.”
The Charité has a longstanding reputation for treating foreign patients, including prominent political ones from the Arabic and Russian-speaking worlds, as well as from Africa. In 2012 it sent a team of medical staff to treat the Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko for back pain in prison, and in 2014 she was flown to Berlin for treatment at the hospital.
Paul Ziemiak, general secretary of the ruling CDU, indicated on Thursday that Germany was ready to treat Navalny, saying: “If it’s desired, we have the possibility to help with the treatment.” Angela Merkel, speaking at a meeting on Thursday with president Emmanuel Macron of France, added her support, saying: “What is now very, very important is that this is urgently resolved.”
The Charité’s reputation as a hub for foreign VIP patients was already strong during the cold war when, as the leading hospital in the communist German Democratic Republic, it treated international figureheads such as the Palestinian political leader Yasser Arafat. Its international patients department, which advertises for patients, says on its website that it will “ensure that international patients benefit optimally from the excellence of the Charité”, and that it has translators in English, Arabic and Russian. It adds: “The consideration of cultural and confessional customs is just as much a part of our philosophy as the personal care before, during and after your stay.”
While Russian doctors refused to release Navalny on Friday morning, Bizilj told German media he was optimistic that it would still be possible to airlift the activist to Berlin. “Two years ago, when we transported [Verzilov], there were delays, but in the end everything worked,” he said.

Germany is expected to extend its pandemic furlough scheme to 24 months after Angela Merkel indicated that she welcomed the proposal to let the Kurzarbeit programme run on.
The chancellor’s spokesperson said on Monday she was “positively” inclined towards the suggestion to extend the scheme, which allows firms to put their staff on part-time work to reduce their cost. Britain’s furlough scheme initially only allowed staff to be sent home and not work, but staff have been allowed to work part-time since July.
The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, first proposed extending the benefit programme, which is currently limited to claims lasting a maximum of 12 months, on Sunday. “The corona crisis won’t suddenly disappear in the next few weeks,” said Scholz, who was recently announced as the centre-left Social Democrats’ candidate for chancellor in next year’s elections.
He added: “Businesses and employees need a clear signal from the government: we’ve got your back for the long haul in this crisis, so that no one is being let go without need.”
A final decision on an extension, which it is estimated will cost €10bn (£9bn), is expected on 25 August.
The UK furlough scheme is scheduled to end in October. From August employers have had to start contributing towards its cost, first with pension and national insurance contributions, and with 10% and then 20% of wages in the next two months.
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said this month that the decision to wind down the UK furlough was “one of the most difficult decisions” he had had to make. But he said it was not sustainable, and that most other countries were making similar moves to wind down their schemes.
The UK scheme paid 80% of wages, up to £2,500 a month, for about 9.5 million employees at its peak. The total cost to date is nearly £35bn.
Germany’s furlough scheme is modelled on a programme that won the country praise during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Called Kurzarbeit (“short work”), it is essentially an unemployment benefit paid out to companies by the government’s Federal Employment Agency, designed to compensate lost earnings for workers who have been temporarily placed on reduced hours, and help companies avoid cutting jobs.
While the economic output of Europe’s powerhouse suffered a 10% slump in the second quarter of 2020, the furlough scheme has so far largely absorbed the accompanying shock on the labour market. German unemployment in July was at 6.3%, an annual increase of a mere 1.3 percentage points. In the US, by comparison, unemployment temporarily rose to a record 14.7% in April.
Companies can apply for Kurzarbeit if at least 10% of their workforce have had their working hours cut by more than 10%. By the end of April 2020, German companies had signed up more than 10.1 million workers to the scheme – almost 10 times as many as at the peak of the financial crisis.
However, not all companies that applied for the scheme used it, meaning the actual number of recipients is considerably lower.
According to estimates by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, in July about 5.6 million employees we still on the scheme, which has proved especially popular in the manufacturing and retail sector.
Ifo’s labour market expert Sebastian Link predicted redundancies “in the high hundred thousands” if the scheme ended after 12 months.
Link said there were political reasons why the furlough would not end: “I see it as absolutely inevitable that the Kurzarbeit scheme will be extended, not least because we are facing federal elections next year.
“Whether it’s sensible to do so is another matter; in some areas of the economy, such as the car industry, the furlough scheme could end up actually preventing necessary structural changes.”
When the scheme was last used on a mass scale, it only replaced about 60% of workers’ lost earnings. During the coronavirus crisis, Merkel’s coalition government decided to increase payments: after four months on the scheme, recipients receive about 70% of lost earnings, and about 80% after seven months, if they have lost more than 50% of their working hours.

Countries led by women had “systematically and significantly better” Covid-19 outcomes, research appears to show, locking down earlier and suffering half as many deaths on average as those led by men.
The relative early success of leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern, Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen, Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen and Finland’s Sanna Marin has so far attracted many headlines but little academic attention.
The analysis of 194 countries, published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the World Economic Forum, suggests the difference is real and “may be explained by the proactive and coordinated policy responses” adopted by female leaders.
Even after clear and frequently cited outliers such as New Zealand and Germany – and the US for male leaders – were removed from the statistics, the study found, the case for the relative success of female leaders was only strengthened.
“Our results clearly indicate that women leaders reacted more quickly and decisively in the face of potential fatalities,” said Supriya Garikipati, a developmental economist at Liverpool University, co-author with Reading University’s Uma Kambhampati.
“In almost all cases, they locked down earlier than male leaders in similar circumstances. While this may have longer-term economic implications, it has certainly helped these countries to save lives, as evidenced by the significantly lower number of deaths in these countries.”
The two researchers said they analysed differing policy responses and subsequent total Covid-19 cases and deaths until 19 May, introducing a number of variables to help analyse the raw data and draw reliable comparisons between countries.
Among the datasets considered were GDP, total population, population density and proportion of elderly residents, as well as annual health spending per head, openness to international travel and level of gender equality in society in general.
Since only 19 of the nearly 200 countries were led by women, the authors also created so-called “nearest neighbour” countries to offset the small sample size, pairing Germany, New Zealand and Bangladesh with male-led Britain, Ireland and Pakistan.
“This analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths,” Garikipati said.
She added that while female leaders “were risk averse with regard to lives”, locking their countries down significantly earlier than male leaders, that also suggested they were “more willing to take risks in the domain of the economy”.
When compared according to the “openness to travel” criterion, female-led countries did not experience significantly lower Covid cases but did report lower deaths, the researchers found, concluding that this may suggest “better policies and compliance”.
Garikipati said the evidence of a “significant and systematic difference” showed that even accounting for institutional context and other controls, “being female-led has provided countries with an advantage in the current crisis”.
The researchers said they hoped the study would “serve as a starting point to illuminate the discussion on the influence of national leaders in explaining the differences in country Covid-outcomes”.

Donald Trump has declared war on Germany. In a manner of speaking. Europe’s most important country, potentially America’s most valuable partner, has in the mind of the president become an adversary. Of all Trump’s many foreign policy disasters, this is perhaps his most significant.
In late July, it was announced that retired army colonel Douglas Macgregor, a decorated combat veteran, would become the next ambassador to Berlin. Macgregor is a regular contributor to Trump’s favourite channel of information, Fox News. He has variously suggested that the US border guard should shoot people if they tried to enter illegally from Mexico; described eastern Ukrainians as “Russians”; defended Serbia’s actions against a “Muslim drug mafia” in Kosovo; and criticised Germany for giving “millions of unwanted Muslim invaders” welfare benefits rather than providing more funding for its armed services.
Most painfully for his new hosts, Macgregor seems to have sided with the far right in talking down Nazi crimes. He described the concept of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (coming to terms with history), which has underpinned culture and politics since the war, as a “sick mentality that says that generations after generations must atone sins of what happened in 13 years of German history and ignore the other 1,500 years of Germany”.
If the Senate’s foreign relations committee confirms Macgregor’s nomination, he will replace another Fox shock-jock commentator. No sooner had Richard Grenell arrived in Berlin in 2018 than he went on the offensive, vowing to “empower other conservatives” across Europe. By that, he did not mean Angela Merkel’s coalition, but nationalists surrounding her, such as in Hungary and Poland. A number of German MPs called for Grenell to be declared persona no grata. Merkel resisted, but the affair spoke volumes for the collapse in ties.
Trump rewarded Grenell for his work, promoting him to acting director of national security in Washington. In a further demonstration of pique, he announced last month the withdrawal of nearly 12,000 troops from bases in Germany.
From the outset, Trump loathed Merkel. She represents everything he is not. On the international stage, she respects interlocutors who do their preparation and don’t spring surprises. She disdains his visceral vulgarity. The leader who let in a million of the world’s most destitute in 2015 refuses to be cowed by a bigot and bully.
She couldn’t be accused of not trying to get along. In March 2017, two months into his administration, she flew to Washington for their first meeting. She prepped assiduously. She studied a 1990 Playboy interview that had become a set text on Trumpism for policymakers. She read his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal. She even watched episodes of his TV show, The Apprentice.
It started badly. She offered him a handshake in the Oval Office in front of the cameras. He didn’t take it. Her studied lack of emotion and her deeply analytical mind were anathema to him. Her aides say she learned to explain complicated problems to him by reducing them to bite-size chunks. He read this as high-handedness.
Trump has a track record of misogyny and some cite this as the reason for his dislike. Others put it down to a narcissistic resentment of praise conferred on others. When she was chosen as Time magazine’s person of the year in 2015, he said: “They picked the person who is ruining Germany.” What particularly upset him was the magazine calling her chancellor of the free world. “What Merkel did to Germany, it’s a sad, sad shame.”
Yet this same woman, who from a young age dreamed of driving across the American plains and adored Ronald Reagan for freeing the world (and her native GDR) from communism, is by instinct a staunch Atlanticist.
She has found the setbacks hard to take. Arguably the single worst incident came before Trump. It was the revelation in 2013, courtesy of Edward Snowden, that the National Security Agency had been bugging Merkel’s personal mobile phone for years. She was incandescent when told, for once losing her famous impulse control. In an angry phone exchange with President Barack Obama, deliberately shared with the media, she told him: “This is like the Stasi.”
This relationship has always been complicated. Germans remember with fondness the liberation of their country, the airlift that ended the Russians’ blockade of Berlin. They devoured American culture. They fell in love with John F Kennedy, his 1963 trip to divided Berlin indelibly etched in the history books. But the left fought tooth and nail against nuclear deployments under Reagan. George Bush’s Iraq misadventure drove a terrible wedge, not least his attempts to divide the continent into New and Old Europe. Even with the more centrist and amenable Bill Clinton and Obama there were bad moments.
Successive US administrations have expressed frustration. The Nord Stream gas pipeline, chaired by former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, has underlined Germany’s dangerous energy dependency on Russia. It contradicts Merkel’s otherwise consistently tough approach towards Vladimir Putin. She was instrumental in ensuring that the EU imposed sanctions after the annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Berlin no longer praises China as the gift that keeps on giving and belatedly sees it as a strategic competitor, but Merkel balks at strong criticism of it. As for defence, the failure of Germany to meet the agreed Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence has been a source of irritation.
But nothing comes close to the current situation.
The German foreign policy establishment is clinging to the hope that Trump will be defeated in November. A Biden presidency would not remove all the tensions, but it would signal that the US was moving back towards the diplomatic mainstream. The country that personifies the mainstream would have reason to celebrate.

Germany’s Social Democrats have fired the starting gun in the race to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor by announcing the pragmatist finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as their candidate for the job.
One of the two pillars of 20th-century democracy in Germany, the Social Democratic party (SPD) has seen its support wither away since joining Merkel’s government as a junior coalition partner in 2013. It lies third in the polls behind the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Greens, on about 14% of the vote.
Yet next year’s federal elections will be the first since the second world war in which an incumbent chancellor will not be in the running for the top seat, making the centre-left party hopeful that all could be to play for if it offers up the right candidate.
Scholz, a former mayor of Germany’s second-largest city, Hamburg, surprisingly lost last year’s contest to lead his party but has now secured the support of the SPD’s more leftwing leadership duo, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, to lead the party into next autumn’s election.
A taciturn number-cruncher previously nicknamed Scholzomat for his monotone delivery, the 62-year-old has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking over the finance ministry in 2018, and his popularity has risen further during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The former leader of Juso, the SPD’s youth wing, is a more divisive figure among his own party faithful, many of whom accuse him of lacking the courage to go after banks implicated in the “cum-ex” tax fraud scheme and having failed to detect and prevent the Wirecard accounting scandal.
Supporters say Scholz has played a vital role in shaping the EU’s €750bn (£675bn) Covid-19 recovery plan, which involved a historic break with Germany’s commitment to balanced budgets. They say wooden delivery in interviews and hesitant decision-making have never significantly harmed Merkel’s appeal in her 15 years in the chancellory.
Hailing Scholz as “decisive and experienced”, and “brave even in crisis”, a press release announcing his candidacy left little doubt that the SPD would present its contender as guaranteeing a better chance of continuity with the stable Merkel era than any politician from her own party.
Because of the pandemic, the CDU has postponed until December the party congress that will decide the party’s future leadership, and therefore the likely candidate leading the party into next year’s elections.
The Green party, currently second in polls on about 19% of the vote, is likely to field an official chancellor candidate for the first time in its history."

The other day, I had a dream. I dreamed that I was sitting on a beach in the summer of 2030 and looking back on how Germany had saved Europe.
The German chancellor had brokered a European recovery package after the Covid-19 crisis of 2020, with large grants and loans to help hard-hit south European economies, drawing on shared European borrowing. It had maintained constructive relations between the EU and post-Brexit Britain, helped the citizens of Poland and Hungary to defend liberal democracy, confounded Vladimir Putin by seriously committing to a common European energy policy, used the regulatory power of the EU to curb Facebook, shaped a common strategy towards China and made a world-leading example of Europe’s green new deal.
All this Germany had done by working as “first among equals” with other European countries, while partnering with the US and other democracies around the world. In realising this ambitious agenda, it had kept its civilised, consensual style of politics and the support of its own people. What an achievement for Germany and Europe at the beginning of the 2030s. What a contrast to the beginning of the 1930s.
My daydream was prompted by the €1.8tn (£1.6tn), seven-year EU budget and recovery deal brokered by German chancellor Angela Merkel, along with President Emmanuel Macron and the EU’s institutional leaders, in a marathon summit earlier this month. The door to this breakthrough was opened by a major shift in Germany’s position, accepting the need for fiscal solidarity. A year ago I despaired so much of major change coming from the grand coalition government in Berlin that I argued that the only way to get essential reform in Europe was for that government to go. History proved me wrong in the way history has a habit of proving everyone wrong – through a totally unexpected development.
With what Hegel would call the cunning of reason in history, Germany’s long overdue shift was precipitated by a previously unknown virus of Asian origin and a ruling of the German constitutional court. The former made it clear even to a sceptical German public that south European countries were suffering from a disaster no one could say was their own fault, and therefore deserved economic solidarity. The latter, firing a warning shot over the bows of the European Central Bank, made it clear that everything could not be left to the monetary policy of the bank. A Europe-wide fiscal response was needed as well. Precisely as I dared to hope in a commentary earlier this year, Merkel has seized the opportunity with both hands. Hats off to her.
But there are also longer-term developments underpinning my hopeful dream. Berlin now has a critical mass of politicians, officials, journalists, thinktanks and foundations who are thinking hard about what Europe’s strategy should be – and not just for the current German presidency of the EU. If a black-green (CDU/CSU-Green) coalition government emerges from next autumn’s general election, that will only strengthen its European commitment. In the European Council on Foreign Relations’ recent EU-wide survey of foreign policy professionals, 97% of those asked said Germany is the most influential country in the EU and 82% identified it as the “most-contacted” country. In Europe, Germany is the indispensable nation.
Yet, awoken from my daydream by a cold shower of rain, something the British summer is always happy to provide, I see two major difficulties down the road ahead. Ever since the first unification of Germany, a century and a half ago, the country has wrestled with the problem of what Kurt-Georg Kiesinger, a federal chancellor in the 1960s, called its “critical size”. His near-namesake, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, put it more pithily: “too big for Europe, too small for the world”. Kissinger’s formulation is brilliant but not quite right. Germany is too big to be just another European country, but it’s not big enough to be a hegemon even in Europe, let alone in the world.
So however wise a German strategy may be, it cannot be realised without a set of international partners. The giant challenges of climate change and the emergent authoritarian superpower China – which is to the early 21st century world what Wilhelmine Germany was to early 20th century Europe – cannot be addressed unless you have the United States under a President Joe Biden returning to a constructive internationalism, and the strategic engagement of powers like Australia, Japan and India. Europe’s own problems cannot be solved without the active involvement not just of France and Spain but also of Italy (understandably preoccupied with its own internal problems), Poland (currently peddling an archaic anti-German line), the Netherlands and others. For foreign and security policy, Europe also needs the clout of Britain – which is the big strategic reason for Merkel to try to broker the Brexit deal which I believe still can be done this autumn.
The other great unknown is German public opinion. On the face of it, there seems to be a solid pro-European, internationalist consensus in German society. But underneath, there are some worrying trends. The outside world is always alert to any possible revival of a greater Germany tendency, yet more prevalent is still the greater Switzerland tendency: just leave us alone to be rich and free. The German stereotype of south Europeans in the Eurozone scrounging off virtuous, hardworking north Europeans has not simply disappeared. The way electoral support surged for the xenophobic nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) following the refugee crisis was a worrying sign. So are well-documented reports of far-right sympathies in the military and security services. And contemporary Germany society has not yet gone through the test of really hard times at home.
To be denounced by Donald Trump as “delinquent” must be infuriating, but the emotional extremism of German alienation from the United States goes far beyond eminently rational anti-Trumpism. A real ideological and geopolitical myopia is revealed in the finding of a recent Körber foundation poll that only 37% of Germans think having close relations with the US is more important for Germany than having close relations with China, while a staggering 36% say it’s more important to get on with China and another 13% favour equidistance.
Germany cannot simply conjure up the necessary international partners, but this is something that’s in its own hands. As a distinguished former German ambassador to China, Volker Stanzel, has argued, foreign policy can no longer be left to the elites. It needs to be anchored in a much wider process of education and democratic debate. That’s all the more true because, due to the country’s “critical size” and the shadows of its past, the international role that the German public needs to understand and support is this historically unusual, difficult, carefully balanced one. For Germany can never be the prancing hegemon, just the steady, skilful football midfielder who keeps the whole team together – and doesn’t even get the applause for scoring goals. Yet sometimes those midfielders are the true heroes of the team.

Angela Merkel’s government has called for more realism from the UK in the ongoing trade and security talks, after the EU capitals were given a “sobering” update by Michel Barnier following the recent round of Brexit negotiations.
After a presentation by the EU’s chief negotiator to ambassadors from the 27 member states on Friday, a spokesman for the German government, which holds the rolling EU presidency, said the bloc was ready to move negotiations quickly forward but “expressed the need for more realism in London”.
The comments will be a blow to Downing Street, where it had been hoped the resolution of the EU’s internal budget and recovery fund debate would allow Merkel and the other leaders to intervene and unblock the negotiation following a month of little progress.
“With the [budget] now wrapped up we hope member states will become more engaged in this process in Brussels and get them moving forward politically in a helpful way,” a UK source close to the negotiations said.
The two sides completed their latest round of negotiations in London on Thursday without being able to agree on the basic outlines of a deal to reassure businesses about the future, which Boris Johnson had said in June should be possible.
But despite publicly warning on Thursday that a deal by the end of the year appeared “unlikely” given the British position on fisheries and Brussels’ demands for a “level playing field”, sources said Barnier had not been overly pessimistic in his presentation on Friday.
He warned the ambassadors that he believed negotiations needed to be wrapped up by the beginning of October due to the lengthy ratification process.
Echoing the language recently used by the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, Barnier said that even if the deal on offer was “low quality”, as recently claimed by the British official, a “zero tariff, zero quota” agreement was a prize worth having.
He added the EU would be open to revisiting some issues next year to strike separate agreements if the current negotiation was successful.
The two main obstacles to a deal remain the access of European fishing fleets to British waters and arrangements to ensure neither side can undercut the other by lowering regulatory standards or unfairly subsidising industry.
It is understood a number of the eight member states with the greatest interest in fishing access reiterated to the room of ambassadors that they would not agree to a deal without agreement on fisheries.
Last week’s talks on fishing access focused on quota-sharing arrangements and the list of stocks for which shares need to be agreed. Barnier claimed the UK was effectively excluding European fleets from key stocks of fish in a move that risked destroying the bloc’s fishing industry.
After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.
The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.
With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.
The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain.
Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.
It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.
Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in “embryo”. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher.
Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.
Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.
A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people"".
Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.
Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights.
Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”
Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.
EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.
Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.
David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party
The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister
After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.
On level playing field clauses, both sides have agreed there should be a “non-regression” on labour, the environment and climate standards as they stand at the end of the transition period.
The EU is demanding a “forward-looking” mechanism to ensure there is no regulatory undercutting in the future should the EU further develop its rulebook.
There is a deadlock on state aid rules, with Brussels calling for the UK to publish its plans for controlling subsidies once the UK is outside the single market and customs union. Downing Street has so far appeared reluctant to respond to Barnier’s pressure, insisting its rulebook is wholly independent from the EU now the country has left the bloc.
EU sources said there was concern in Brussels that interest in striking a deal was waning in London but that an agreement in September remained the most likely outcome given the economic damage of failure.

This is the week that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak began softening up doctors, teachers and other public sector workers for a squeeze to their pay and cuts to their departmental budgets. They have done their best to muffle that particular bit of bad news. Instead, aides to the publicity-conscious Mr Sunak briefed journalists on an inflation-busting pay rise for public servants – and on Tuesday got the desired morning headlines. Later that same day, the chancellor admitted it was a one-off for this financial year, and that over the longer run “we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards”. Meaning cuts are coming. It had been a crass and short-lived publicity trick: flash the cash in a big show now, then admit it would all be taken back in time. Not only that but, as the Trades Union Congress pointed out, in all the government’s trumpeting of its apparent largesse, little acknowledgement was given that there would be no such increment for jobcentre advisers, local government employees or care workers.
Spin is a hardly a novelty on Downing Street, but the prime minister has developed a new, yet increasingly tiresome, strategy: blurt a falsehood, confess the truth, then hope the furore around the initial fib fixes it all the more firmly in voters’ minds. So Mr Johnson postures as the new Roosevelt, then announces a small spending commitment – but evidently hopes busy and only half-attentive voters will be left with the magic words “new deal”.
He also promises that “we are absolutely not going back to the austerity of 10 years ago”. And yet the Treasury this week warned ministers that this autumn’s comprehensive spending review would be full of “tough choices” (meaning cuts) and that “departments should be identifying opportunities to reprioritise and deliver savings”. The government that went into this pandemic promising to do “whatever it takes” had to be shamed by a footballer into providing meals to hungry children over the school holidays, and has left deep in the red local authorities that stepped up in this historic crisis. Ministers have spent the past few months issuing rhetorical cheques that they must know will never be matched by hard money. It is a deeply dishonest way of doing politics and one of its ultimate results will be to corrode further the trust that voters place in the state. Perhaps that is the objective.
One upshot of the past few days is that autumn’s spending review will probably usher in a round of austerity. Mr Sunak will talk of the huge cost of the pandemic and point to the state of public finances, then lay out plans for cut after spending cut to areas such as local government, perhaps seasoned with just a few tax rises. If he does that, he will be committing economic folly and a huge political gamble.
First, the economics. This month alone, businesses from Harrods to Poundstretcher, Jaguar Land Rover to Accenture have announced job losses. The fear of more to come, along with the uncertainties of dealing with a virus about which scientists still know comparatively little, will prevent businesses from investing and expanding, and will deter households from major spending. In this situation, the state needs to spend money until, as John Maynard Keynes wrote, the private sector recovers its animal spirits. In Germany, the spiritual homeland of austerity, Angela Merkel has grasped this point: her conservative government is vastly outspending the UK this year (as a proportion of national income). So, for that matter, is Donald Trump in the United States. And neither of those two countries is set to end the year by pulling out of a historic trading bloc on terms that are still unclear.
The political gamble of another few years of austerity would be huge. Research shows that those voters hit hardest by George Osborne’s cuts last decade were also those who supported leave in the 2016 referendum. Another round of cuts in an economy as structurally weak as the UK’s would not only diminish Mr Johnson’s fan club, it would make our democracy even more volatile. Labour lost the last austerity wars by not arguing strongly against the cuts. The opposition must not make the same mistake this time."

EU leaders have reached a historic agreement on a €750bn coronavirus pandemic recovery fund and their long-term spending plans following days of acrimonious debate at the bloc’s longest summit in nearly two decades.
As the meeting reached its fifth day, the 27 exhausted heads of state and government finally gave their seal of approval to a plan for the EU to jointly borrow debt to be disbursed through grants on an unprecedented scale, in the face of an economic downturn not seen since the Great Depression.
The end of the tortuous process was announced by the European council president, Charles Michel, who had been chairing the leaders’ long debates, with a single word on Twitter: “Deal!”
Deal!
The euro rose against the dollar on the news to stand at $1.145. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as a “historic day for Europe”.
Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said the negotiations, lasting more than 90 hours, had been “worth it” and that the EU could not be accused this time of doing “too little, too late”.
Talks for the hard-won deal pitted north against south and east against west as governments haggled over the terms of both the bloc’s seven-year budget and a one-off economic stimulus.
The summit, stretching from Friday morning into the early hours of Tuesday, was so prolonged that two leaders, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg and Ireland’s Micheál Martin, briefly returned home before coming back to Brussels.
Despite initial opposition from the so-called frugal states of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark, agreement was finally found, following a final 5.15am session of the 27 on Tuesday morning, to disburse vast sums in the form of non-repayable grants to countries most stricken by the coronavirus pandemic.
The breakthrough followed a new proposal from Michel for the EU to pay out €390bn in grants and €360bn in loans from the new economic reconstruction fund.
The “frugal” states had been pushing for the original proposal by the European commission for €500bn in grants to be reduced to €350bn, to the evident frustration of Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, had at one stage warned his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, who led the way on reducing the level of grants, that he might become a hero at home but that he faced being blamed by the rest of Europe for his lack of solidarity.
But Michel’s new formulation, emerging out of hours of bilateral talks with the leaders on both sides of the debate outside of the full plenary sessions, finally received the unanimous support it required.
“This recovery fund is indeed a historic change and a historic step for Europe,” said Macron, in a joint press conference with Merkel.
At one point during the bad-tempered negotiations Macron had thumped the table in frustration and likened those thwarting his spending plans to the ill-fated British in previous budget negotiations.
The final outcome is a messy bundle of compromises. As part of the deal, the “frugals” will receive significant increases in the rebates they receive on their budget contributions, a throwback from 1984 when Margaret Thatcher secured discounts on the UK’s outsized budget contributions.
Merkel said the British departure had changed the balance among the remaining 27 members and created a new dynamic.
Michel also watered down his initial proposal for holding up the disbursement of funds both where there are concerns over either a lack of promised economic reform or the state of the rule of law in a country.
Where there are fears that reforms are not being implemented by member states in receipt of money, any one EU leader can halt the disbursement to allow the European council of the 27 heads of state and government to “exhaustively” debate the situation.
On the rule of law, France, Germany and other countries had wanted a link to EU funds but Hungary and Poland’s governments, who have been previously accused of undermining judicial independence and minority rights, rejected this plan.
The compromise agreed by the leaders instead puts off designing a rule of law mechanism for another day with agreement to be made by a qualified majority of member states.
The final deal also swung in Poland’s favour by watering down a demand to link green transition funds to signing up to the 2050 climate target to the consternation of activist groups and senior MEPs.
Poland, which stands to gain €37bn in grants from the fund, plus potentially billions more from a “just transition fund” to move away from coal, is the only EU member state not to have made the 2050 pledge.
While EU leaders agreed to increase the core recovery fund, the so-called recovery and resilience facility, they cut proposed funding for a specific climate programme, as well as research and health - all priorities for the “frugal” four.
The recovery and resilience facility, the main economic stimulus to the coronavirus recession, is intended to help fund the EU transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2050, but environmentalists have criticised the vagueness of that promise. A specific fund to help countries ditch coal, the just transition fund, saw its budget slashed to €17.5bn down from a proposed €37.5bn.
Beyond a debate about the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, leaders had to haggle over the EU’s seven-year budget, which is due to start next year.
Michel secured agreement on €1.074tn on EU programmes although the leaders will face severe opposition in the European parliament to its reduced size when it is brought to the chamber for MEPs’ agreement.
The Brussels summit, the first in-person meeting of the leaders for five months, was just a few minutes shorter than the record-holding meeting in Nice 20 years ago when leaders debated EU enlargement."

Bad-tempered, late-running EU summits have hardly been unusual over the last decade of eurozone crisis and endless rows over migration. But the latest gathering of EU leaders, now in its fourth day with no end in sight, may be one of the most acrimonious yet.
With a €1.8tn (£1.6tn) financial plan on the table, the stakes are huge. Nobody expected talks to be easy, but expectations of a historic step towards EU fiscal union had risen since Angela Merkel abandoned Germany’s long-standing opposition to shared debt – reversing the position she took during the eurozone crisis.
After a friendly start, where EU leaders exchanged playful elbow bumps and birthday greetings, the temperature soon plummeted.
Dinner on Friday evening was “a bit surly” according to the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, after other leaders rounded on him over his insistence on being able to veto others’ access to a €750bn coronavirus recovery fund, if their economic reforms were deemed inadequate. Bulgaria’s prime minister, Boyko Borissov, accused Rutte of wanting to be “the police of Europe”, while Poland’s leader, Mateusz Morawiecki, called Rutte and his “frugal” north European allies “misers”. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, accused the frugals of blackmail.
The second big fight centred on the size of recovery fund grants: a proposed €500bn in grants for the hardest hit countries has been shaved down to €390bn. But it remains unclear if that is acceptable for the frugal club of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and unofficial member, Finland.
Leaders battled through Sunday night over the size of recovery grants, finally quitting the Europa HQ shortly after 5.45am. As tempers flared during the small hours, Emmanuel Macron banged his fist on the table, saying he was ready to walk out if “sterile blockages” continued. The French president criticised Rutte for behaving like David Cameron, the former UK prime minister whose EU strategy “ended badly” in Macron’s words.
The British are the ghosts at the negotiating table – another big stumbling block is the size of the rebates on offer to the frugal four, discounts on their EU budget contributions that came after Margaret Thatcher got “our money back” in 1984.
The previous night, Merkel and Macron walked out of midnight talks with the frugals – a display of unity by the Franco-German pair, who first proposed a massive recovery fund underpinned by taboo-breaking EU borrowing on financial markets to pull the EU out of the worst recession in its history.
At stake is a €750bn coronavirus recovery plan intended to pull the EU out of a historic recession, as well as a €1.074tn seven-year budget. One big row is how far countries should be able to access grants. France and Germany, backed by the European commission, proposed €500bn in grants (the rest in loans) targeted at countries hardest hit by coronavirus. That has been whittled down to €390bn in a compromise plan, but whether it will be accepted remains unclear.
Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron think the unprecedented crisis requires serious financial firepower, backed by Italy and Spain, who see Covid-19 as a test case for European solidarity.  A group of northern states - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden,  styled the “frugal four” - are wary of fiscal transfers.  Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte takes the most hardline position, as he also wants his government to be able to veto recovery funds if a recipient is deemed failing on economic reforms.
Adding to the complexity is an argument  over tying EU funds to respect for democratic values. Hungary and Poland, currently subject to EU inquiries on the rule of law, want a veto on any attempt to remove funds from a rogue government. France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, who fear the weakening of democratic checks and balances, say there must be a link. Now some diplomats fear the issue could become hostage to a recovery plan deal.

“They ran off in a bad mood,” Rutte complained. “We are ready to compromise without giving up ambition,” said Macron.
Yet by Monday, Macron said there was “a spirit of compromise”, while Rutte said “progress had been made”.
The third battleground also put the Dutch in the firing line, as Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, compared Rutte to the communist police. The Netherlands, along with many EU governments, wants to tie European funds to upholding democratic values – a plan staunchly opposed by Hungary and Poland, both subject to EU investigations on the rule of law.
The communist police used “unclarified legal terms, exactly the same which is written in the proposal of the Dutchman,” said Orbán recalling his own encounters with state police as a young activist.
Orbán’s chief spokesman tweeted that “only Hungarians should get to decide how to spend the money that belongs to [Hungary]” – a stance that is likely to raise hackles, as the country receives six times more from the EU than it pays in.
Some EU diplomats fear that western Europe’s united stance on the rule of law is beginning to fragment. “It’s a bargaining chip,” said one EU diplomat. The frugals give the impression “we might settle for less rule of law, if you agree to the overall recovery plan”, the diplomat said.
As the fourth day wore on, agreement on the €1.8tn deal (the EU’s next seven-year budget and recovery plan) was still hanging in the balance. Some EU sources are already pencilling in a rematch summit in late July or late August – the latter seen as providing more breathing space for countries to rethink their red lines. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned against a quick deal that falls short. “The leaders’ agreement should be ambitious in terms of size and composition of the package ... even if it takes a bit more time,” she told Reuters.
The longer EU leaders stay in Brussels, the higher the political price of leaving with no deal. Failure to agree will weigh heavily on the EU. The hardest-hit countries already have access to a €540bn financial cushion, but France, Germany, Italy and Spain see this as inadequate to the scale of the looming recession.
Leaving Brussels empty-handed would also be a damaging political blow, tarnishing the EU’s prestige and triggering questions about its ability to act in a crisis. It would also undermine the newish leaders of the EU institutions, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the architect of the recovery plan, as well the European council president, Charles Michel, the main deal-broker.
Even with a deal, this bitter summit has exposed poisonous mistrust between some leaders, as well as the EU’s struggle to deal with nationalists in central Europe, who are feared to be trampling on Europe’s basic values. A few bad-tempered days in Brussels may leave political scars."

Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, accused his Dutch counterpart of using the same methods as his country’s former communist leaders on Sunday, as EU leaders publicly clashed during tense and acrimonious negotiations over the terms of a proposed €1.8tn budget and recovery package for the bloc.
A third difficult day of a summit of the EU’s 27 heads of state and government – the first in person for five months – saw movement towards agreement as talks stretched deep into the night, but laid bare the deep splits between north and south, and east and west.
At a late evening dinner, the European council president, Charles Michel, who is chairing the summit, asked the leaders whether they were “capable of building European unity and trust. Or, through a tear, will we present the face of a weak Europe, undermined by mistrust?”
Dutch prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Monday EU leaders were making progress but warned discussions could still fall apart. “At times it didn’t look good last night, but I feel that on the whole we are making progress,” Rutte told reporters in Brussels. The summit will reconvene at 4pm central European time on Monday.

The leaders have been in intense debates over the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and the EU’s seven-year budget, known as the multi-financial framework, which is due to start next year.
There are also stark differences over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer. The money will be borrowed from the capital markets by the European commission.
Rutte has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for the EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say.
In response, Orbán, the nationalist prime minister of Hungary, who was an anti-communist dissident in his youth, accused Rutte of aping Soviet methods to crush dissent by failing to properly set out the terms on which funds would be blocked.
The Netherlands is seeking reassurance that commonly issued debt will be properly spent and wants the ability to hold back disbursements where there are governance concerns.
“They would like to introduce a new mechanism that didn’t exist until now,” Orbán told reporters, of the Dutch proposal for a country to be able to stop funding to member states undermining the rule of law. “I think it is questionable whether it has a basis in the treaty at all. I am coming from an ex-communist country. When the communist regime decided to attack us, they use unclarified legal terms exactly as the same as written in the proposal of the Dutch man … Saying ‘general deficiencies’. When I was arrested by the police and I asked them what I had done which is illegal, they say general deficiencies. What the hell does it mean?”
In response, Rutte said on Monday: “We are not here because we are going to be visitors at each others birthday party later. We are here because we do business for our own country. We are all pros.”
The row over the rule of law was dwarfed, however, by a more significant dispute over the size and form of the recovery fund, with “frugal” countries of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden defying France and Germany in trying to reduce the level of grants.
EU diplomats said the four northern member states, to the evident frustration of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, were pushing to reduce the value of grants available from €500bn to €350bn while increasing the size of the rebates they currently have on their budget contributions. The whole recovery package would also be reduced to €700bn from the €750bn initially proposed by the European commission.
Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said that in seven years of attending EU meetings, “I have never seen positions as diametrically opposed as this”.
“The negotiations are difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever been involved in, yet the spirit of compromise has not yet disappeared,” tweeted Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjanis Karinš.
With tempers running high, Macron at one point banged his fists on the table in frustration. He also claimed that the countries seeking to reduce the size of the recovery fund were acting like the former British prime minister David Cameron during previous budget negotiations, warning that such an approach would end badly and damage Europe.
During Sunday night’s dinner, several leaders made emotional interventions. The Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned Rutte that hero status at home would “last a few days” but that he risked being blamed for letting Europe down.
The summit had been markedly bad-tempered from the first day on Friday, and Michel was forced to table a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot the talks.
Michel had looked to trim €50bn off the amount of grants and to give a member state the power to hold up the disbursement of funds by making a “request within three days … to bring the matter without delay, to the European council or [finance ministers] to satisfactorily address the matter”.
In recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.
Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.
How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.
This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.
Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.
Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.
In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.
Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.
However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”
The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.
In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.

Macron told reporters of his concerns about attempts to reduce the size of the recovery package, insisting there would not be a deal “made at the cost of European ambition”. Merkel had warned there was no guarantee of success.
A second meeting has been pencilled in for the last week of July but there are concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections could stand in the way.

EU leaders were poles apart on the terms of a €1.8tn (£1.6tn) budget and recovery package as they met for the first time in five months on Friday, with Angela Merkel warning of the possibility of talks dragging into a second destabilising summer summit.
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told fellow leaders in Brussels they had an “obligation” to agree on a response to an economic downturn unparalleled since the Great Depression.
His comments were echoed by Italy’s Giuseppe Conte, whose country, like Spain, was among those hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and faces a devastating recession.
But EU diplomats said little progress had been made in the first day of what were described as “intense discussions”. “So far the temperature in the room hasn’t substantially risen”, an EU diplomat said. “It seems leaders are preserving their energy for what is to come.” The summit is slated to finish on Saturday but it could run on into Sunday if the negotiations are fruitful, sources said.
The German chancellor, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, offered a notably downbeat assessment about the level of unity among leaders as she arrived in Brussels.
“The differences are still very large and so I can’t predict that we will achieve a result this time,” Merkel said. “It would be desirable, but we also have to be realistic. And it really does take a great deal of willingness to compromise on the part of everyone if we are to achieve something that is good for Europe. In this respect I expect very difficult negotiations.”
Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have backed plans to borrow on the capitals markets to fund a €750bn recovery package, but others are at loggerheads over the size of the plan, the terms under which the cash is distributed, and the conditions attached.
There are also major obstacles in getting agreement on the EU’s next seven-year budget, which is due to start next year. The so-called frugal countries of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark are lobbying for less spending but they are also seeking to retain their valuable budget rebates. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she planned to push for cuts to the budget ceiling. “We are not in favour of just spending a lot more money in Brussels,” she said.
The European parliament, however, wants to loosen the purse strings and has threatened to block a proposal from the European council president, Charles Michel, to spend nearly €1.1tn over the seven years, a smaller sum than previously tabled.
Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said he believed the chance of finding agreement given the differences was “less than 50%. What’s more, in the end, content is more important than speed. A weak compromise will not take Europe any further.”
Rutte said Hungary’s rejection of any rule-of-law conditions on the distribution of the recovery fund could be “a very big problem”. Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, has threatened to veto any deal that would involve the commission linking the quality of governance at home with a right to EU handouts.
Hungary is facing EU proceedings over claims it has undermined the independence of the country’s judiciary.
A source said that during Friday’s discussions Denmark’s prime minister had been “leading charge on the ceiling and rebates with France demanding the EU to put an end to the rebates. The Netherlands made its case for a new governance mechanism.”

But now it has a new target: the chancellor. By  Thomas Meaney
‘It would be ideal if you could hit a deer,” Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Europe’s largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung, told his chauffeur. “Guardian readers could do with a bit more colour.” We had reached escape velocity out of ice-encrusted Düsseldorf. The Mercedes S-Class locked into place like a bobsled on the Autobahn. I sat shotgun with Reichelt’s assortment of sports gear, a hockey stick between my legs. “We are lucky in our driver today,” Reichelt said, deadpan. “Last time we hit a wild boar and the boar and the car went flying.”
I was travelling with Reichelt on one of his publicity tours across Germany. For the past two years, he has made an appointment once a month to commune with groups of Bild’s 1.3 million readers. “You have to feel their emotions,” he told me from the backseat. “You have to listen to their hearts.”
Reichelt, who is 40, made his name as a war reporter in Syria, but today confines most of his battle courage to Twitter, where he enjoys needling the German political establishment and barging into leftwing echo chambers. In person, Reichelt exudes a twitchy exuberance, like a fighter pilot who has managed to smuggle champagne into the cockpit. His eyes restlessly gauge the world around him, clocking who he needs to avoid and who he needs to attract. Into his phone, he volleys directives to subeditors, assistants and the band of young male disciples he sends around the world to collect stories. “The leading populist in western Germany,” is how Albrecht von Lucke, editor of the prestigious left-liberal monthly Blätter, describes him.
Available at train stations, supermarkets, bakeries, kiosks, factories, Portuguese beach resorts, online, and everywhere else Germans buy things, Bild Zeitung squats like a large toad on German life. Bild, which was partly modelled on the Daily Mirror, is the largest newsprint publication in the world that uses Roman characters. Unlike its closest analogue in Britain, the Daily Mail, it has no real national competitors. Twenty regional editions seep into every pore of the country. Each month, its website attracts about 25 million readers. Bild is the prize battleship of Axel Springer, the German company founded in 1945 by the rightwing publisher of the same name. Today, Axel Springer is the largest media publishing firm in Europe, and is valued at about €7bn. Last year, the US private equity firm KKR acquired a 44% stake in the company.
For decades, Bild was an object of scorn for any self-respecting West German of social democratic orientation. In a political culture more conformist and decorous than most of its western peers, Bild functioned like the Las Vegas strip, concentrating all of the Federal Republic’s seediness in one place. Seven days a week, Bild pumped free-market mantras, alongside ads for car tyres and chicken wings, into the stiff arteries of cold war West Germany. Bild decried long hair on men and the marriage of its top models to foreigners. It genuflected before South African apartheid, Greek dictatorship, Bavarian sedans and American Pershing missiles. Above all, Bild dedicated itself to the destruction of communist East Germany, and fought a long battle against what it viewed as enemy collaborators in the leftist student movement at home.
Such was the stature of Bild in West Germany that in 1965, after the daily rose in price from 10 to 15 pfennigs, Axel Springer, who referred to Bild as his “dog on a chain”, proposed to Chancellor Ludwig Erhard that the state introduce a special 15 pfennig coin to make it easier to purchase the paper. Meanwhile, the East German Stasi was so impressed by Bild as a state propaganda tool that it crafted its own – imaginatively titled – NEUE Bild Zeitung, which was sold at the border with West Germany, where it conspicuously failed to wean class enemies off the original.
Today Bild is paradoxically less influential than it was in the 60s, but more politically important. “I read it first in the morning because it is the agenda-setter,” says Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of the liberal weekly, Die Zeit. “Politicos in Berlin probably read it first in the morning as well.” The paper enjoys a close relationship with the German political elite. The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was one of the best men at the wedding of former Bild editor, Kai Diekmann, and in 2008, Diekmann performed the same role for Kohl at his wedding. “Kohl rules with Bild,” the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll wrote, and Kohl’s successor as chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, affirmed the practice: “To govern I need Bild, Bild Sunday’s edition, and the telly,” he once said.
Bild’s intimate relationship with some of Germany’s most powerful figures is a vestige of its days as the country’s decisive reputation maker-and-breaker. The former defence minister, now the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has shown up at one of Reichelt’s dinner parties at the Bild offices in Berlin, and for the past few years Bild has hosted part of the annual Munich Security Conference, the equivalent of Davos for the global defence industry. Although Angela Merkel has not ingratiated herself with the Springer complex — despite receiving early political support from Bild — her husband is nevertheless paid €10,000 a year to grace the board of the nonprofit Friede Springer Foundation, named after Axel Springer’s widow.
Despite its traditional proximity to power, Bild has mutated into something beyond a stalwart defender of the German status quo. Now, says Joffe, it is “an equal-opportunity anti-establishment force”. “Previous Bild editors made their alliances more based on personal feeling,” says the journalist Stefan Niggemeier, who in 2004 co-founded the BILDBlog, a website that corrects Bild’s factual errors and misrepresentations. “But Reichelt is different. He is an actually political person.”
Reichelt’s agenda is marked less by novelty than by a chest-crunching resuscitation of Bild’s core commitments: pro-US, pro-Nato, pro-Israel, pro-austerity, pro-capital, anti-Russia, anti-China. According to the Bild worldview, the best way to counter the left is to portray its demands as totalitarian, and the best way to kill off the far right is to cannibalise its grievances. While Bild prints relatively little material that a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would object to, Reichelt sees the party as a threat to his effort to remake the German political scene. “We want nothing to do with the imbeciles of the AfD,” he told me. “The way to destroy them is to make room for their voters in what used to be the political mainstream of this country.”
Bild’s main attack targets remain Germany’s “Gutmenschen” – the do-gooders, vegetarians, Greens and 1968ers who are treated as parasites and irritants to Germany’s robust economy and middle class. More recently, the paper’s sights have also turned on Merkel and her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “The paper’s constant targeting of Merkel, but also its current take on refugees and all sorts of minorities definitely reproduces rhetorical elements of the AfD,” says Fatma Aydemir, a novelist and columnist for the leftwing daily Tageszeitung, known as Taz. In the absence of serious challenges from within Merkel’s own party, or from other parties – she has been chancellor for 14 years, a tenure surpassed only by Kohl and Bismarck – Bild has attempted to make itself into that opposition. Yet any populist challenger finds itself in the hard position of convincing Germans that Merkel’s very successful form of reactive politics has run out of historical steam. “We are the voice of ordinary people,” claims Reichelt. “If we didn’t exist, they would really think the whole system is against them.”
We pulled into the fire station in the proud town of Sprockhövel, about 18 miles north-east of Düsseldorf, where a few dozen people greeted us, most of them in firefighter gear. Bild beer steins, Bild lighters and other Bild paraphernalia had been laid out on the firefighters’ bar. Reichelt marched out to the garage with the fire engines, where a small table stood. He took a sip of beer, and addressed the group with aplomb.
“It’s an honour to be among you because, as you know, I like to meet our readers face to face,” Reichelt said. He wanted to know why they had become firefighters. “It’s that feeling that we’re brothers,” said one of the younger firefighters. “That we have each other’s back. You don’t get that feeling elsewhere.” Yes, Reichelt agreed, courage was in short supply in Germany. Courage: that was a virtue Bild could get behind.
“The only trouble we have with Bild,” said another, old fireman, “is your picture contest!”
Reichelt made a show of pricking up his ears. “Oh really? Is there something we’re doing wrong? I welcome your criticism!”
“It encourages people to send in the most sensational photos possible, but people block the way to fires because they’re trying to take photos for Bild!”
Reichelt’s face registered the gravity of the charge. He moved like a matador, coaxing anyone else with negative things to say to hurl them at his face. “Look, that’s terrible, and we’ll have to stop that. I’ll get on that immediately,” he told the man who complained about the photo contest.
After Reichelt had presided over dinner in the firefighters’ hall, we got back into the Mercedes and sped into the dark. I asked him why he goes out of his way for pow-wows with his readership. “Bild is the last national campfire experience in German life,” he told me. “It’s the last thing that Germans can come together for.” It was a curious way of viewing a newspaper that has, for decades, polarised a country otherwise committed to “consensus politics” into two camps: Bild readers and Bild haters. Yet Reichelt delivered this well-greased lump of Springer-speak with what seemed like sincerity.
The experience of reading Bild is a sugar-rush of gossip, accompanied by the clanging gong of headlines. As is traditional, scandals are designated for the front page, but in Bild’s current iteration, fear-mongering appears to be privileged over celebrity soup: “Germany’s most dangerous gang leader is free again” reads a typical headline. Alongside the main stories, the front page also lists the dollar exchange rate and the price of gold, as well as the “winners” and “losers” of the day. A loser might be Prince Charles, whose charity, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, may have received dark money from Russians. (“Bild says: black money for blue blood!”) Or a loser might be Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, claiming that there is a “large, coordinated campaign” by the German government to fund misinformation in Russia: “Bild says: what nonsense!” Winners tend to be businessmen making big deals or celebrities being nice to children.
The most reliably absurdist section of Bild typically falls on page 3 or 4, with a report from Paul Ronzheimer, Reichelt’s star protege. There one finds Ronzheimer posing in front of a Brazilian forest fire; Ronzheimer posing in front of the Venezuelan opposition leader; Ronzheimer posing in front of a Hong Kong street fight; Ronzheimer posing in front of Syrian refugees; Ronzheimer disbursing fake Drachmas to poor Greeks encouraging them to leave Europe. His stories appear as little frames of text under giant, hard-won selfies, as if to declare: Bild was here! “Ronzheimer does have a discernible function,” says von Lucke. “He makes Bild readers feel like they’re reading a paper that has incredible access, that Bild has a global presence.”
As editor, Reichelt sees himself less as a news impresario than as an emotional entrepreneur. “Journalism is basically about emotions, as all of the other news outlets in this country seem to have forgotten,” he told me. Reichelt likes to point out what he sees as the shared delusions of the more “respectable” German press. He gave the example of Merkel, around whom he said the press had created an “elaborate mythology” that she has such natural wit and is extremely clever, whereas her skill lay in identifying the direction of the prevailing winds.
For Reichelt, Merkel represents the depoliticisation of German society, a process that has obscured the faultlines between conservatives and liberals. For almost two decades, at a series of decisive moments, Merkel has deftly stolen her antagonists’ platforms out from under them. In 2003, she phased in a neoliberal agenda in the CDU, but when it nearly backfired at the polls two years later, she started to introduce programmes from the Social Democrats. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Merkel became anti-nuclear overnight. Merkel’s response to the 1 million migrants entering Germany in the summer of 2015 has been widely interpreted as an instance of principle over pragmatism – a chancellor seizing the chance to make amends for her nation’s past – but even then, Merkel had carefully weighed German public opinion, and promptly ramped up anti-refugee legislation once the middle class’s pro-refugee enthusiasm had subsided. The leftwing sociologist Wolfgang Streeck once described Merkel as “a postmodern politician with a premodern, Machiavellian contempt for both causes and people”.
This shape-shifting has made German politics a much more difficult game to play, and Reichelt sees it as his job to restore the old pre-Merkel divisions. To this end, he has made Bild into a loudspeaker for some of the chancellor’s fiercest critics. In early September 2018, in the wake of violent far-right demonstrations in the Saxon city of Chemnitz, Reichelt met with Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of German intelligence, and offered him the the pulpit of Bild when Maassen wanted to contradict Merkel’s account of anti-migrant “hunts” that had allegedly taken place in Chemnitz. Maassen’s attempt to cast doubt on the chancellor’s version of events got him removed from his post, but it transformed him into one of the most vocal martyrs of the German right.
The real trouble for Merkel’s rightwing critics within her party, however, is that she remains the most popular politician in the land – with her approval ratings reaching 80% during the coronavirus pandemic, considerably higher than her closest European peers. Meanwhile, their own political position – a kind of xenophobic neoliberalism that would stress the free movement of capital over the free movement of “undesirable” people – has been vigorously touted by the AfD. It will take some doing to wrangle their copyright back.
Since his earliest teenage years, Reichelt dreamed of becoming the editor of Bild Zeitung. I asked him how someone like himself, born in Hamburg in 1980 – when Bild was still considered radioactive by most teachers and students across Germany – could have concocted such an ambition. “I was born into a family of journalists,” Reichelt told me. “In our household, Axel Springer was a hero, and Heinrich Böll was an enemy.” Reichelt, who perfected his English abroad at Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, looked up to young Bild reporters as bourgeois paladins pitted against the leftwing rabble of 1980s Hamburg, a city teeming with wealth, but also one of the hubs of the country’s anarchist left.
“You must understand that Bild was right about the three major questions of postwar German life,” Reichelt said. “We backed Israel … , which you can hardly say for the international left. We backed the USA … , which the student protesters didn’t want. And we were convinced that German reunification could work, unlike those leftist worthies, [Jürgen] Habermas and Günter Grass.” Reichelt is correct that Bild had confidence in a reunified Germany that could purge itself of any lingering leftwing utopian residues in the East. “The German left basically gave up on reunification in the 1980s,” Niggemeier told me. “The cause became almost quaint for them. Meanwhile, Axel Springer built the Bild headquarters right smack up against the Berlin Wall – and now, look, it’s in the middle of Berlin. So they can say: ‘We never gave up.’”
It is hard to think of an institution more tightly bound up with the history of the Federal Republic than Bild Zeitung. The first introduction that some young Germans get to the paper today is Günter Wallraff’s withering exposé, Der Aufmacher (The Leader-writer), which continues to be taught in a few secondary schools four decades after its publication. In 1977, Wallraff went undercover in order to try to expose Bild as a giant fabrication mill. Instead he discovered an underworld of cynical publicists intent on becoming cheerleaders of the postwar German economic boom. In one scene, which describes a regular day at the Bild office, one of the Bild reporters listens to a distressed caller who has called into a fake suicide-prevention hotline that Bild has set up, and whispers to Wallraff: “He’s about to jump off the balcony any minute, he’s nearly there!”
I visited Wallraff last year in his light-filled studio in the Ehrenfeld neighbourhood of Cologne. His office is full of African art, and the books of his heroes, such as Upton Sinclair. “In the 1970s and 80s, Bild was in total control of the media, and there was very little being done about it,” Wallraff told me, over a game of ping-pong in his workshop. “If you were their enemy, they made you into a terrorist.”
We retreated back into Wallraff’s studio, where he had the latest copy of Bild. The headline was about Boris Johnson’s hair: “This mop now rules Britain”. “I haven’t flipped through it in a while,” Wallraff told me. “But I can see it’s taken a more civilised tone. You should have seen it in the 1970s: all of the articles in support of the dictatorship in Greece and Chile, the articles in favour of apartheid.”
Wallraff remains a heroic figure for many Germans who remember Bild as an enemy of the student protesters of 1968 – whom the newspaper referred to as “rioters”, “a radical danger”, and “left-academic fascists”. One of Springer’s main targets was the Marxist thinker and activist Rudi Dutschke, who was shot in 1968 in Berlin by a rightwing fanatic inspired by the murderer of Martin Luther King Jr. A few days before the attack, Bild had referred to Dutschke as “State Enemy #1”, and it had previously run headlines such as “Stop Dutschke now!” After the shooting, tens of thousands of people took to thestreets of Berlin, chanting, “Bild shot as well!”. Dutschke suffered brain damage from the attack, and died years later as a result of his injuries.
“West Germany in the 1960s was a completely authoritarian state,” said Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz – Dutschke’s widow, and an author of several books about 1968 – when we met in Berlin earlier this year. “Bild was the symbol of that.” Dutschke-Klotz agrees with Wallraff that Bild is a milder publication today, and that the 1968ers triumphed over it. “Society was full of old Nazis then,” she said. “It was full of people who, outside of the Weimar Republic, had barely lived in a democracy. Bild has been beaten in the cultural sphere, especially if you consider the place of women in society now, or climate politics.”
But in the 60s there were others who took a different view: that what they were witnessing was the irreversible Springerisation of society. Heinrich Böll devoted not one, but three books, including one of his literary masterpieces – The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum – to denouncing Bild, which he credited not only with poisoning public life, but also with wrecking the German language itself with “primitive bon-mot-ism”. Bild, wrote Böll in 1972, was “no longer crypto-fascistic, no longer fascisoid, but naked fascism: incitement, lies, garbage”.
The most visible element of West Germany’s hard left, the Red Army Faction, and its leading voice, Ulrike Meinhof, took Böll’s criticism a considerable step further. In May 1972, after calling for the expropriation of Springer, and holding public hearings against the company, the Red Army Faction bombed the Axel Springer offices in Hamburg, injuring at least 17 people. Meinhof declared the attacks were in the name of Springer’s victims: communists, Palestinians, foreign workers. “Who else were they going to attack?” Dutschke-Klotz told me. “The mayor of Berlin? He had already apologised for attacking student protesters. Bild was the obvious target.”
That was almost 50 years ago. After the cold war, Bild became a celebrity rag, which former adversaries could dismiss as a more innocuous symptom of a depoliticised culture than an ideological lodestar in its own right. Kai Diekmann, who edited the paper from 2001 to 2015, neatly exhibited the contradictions of German conservatism in the Merkel era. A faithful page of Helmut Kohl, he wanted to maintain Germany’s position as the prime European reaper of globalisation – the country’s export model depends on taking advantage of a currency weakened by its fellow Eurozone members – but also attacked expressions of globalisation within Germany’s borders.
In his 2007 screed, The Great Self-Deception, Diekmann railed against the usual suspects of the German right: Muslims, “multi-kulti” liberals and environmentalists. Diekmann’s idea was that the leftwards shuffle of the political consensus – exemplified in Merkel’s long-standing coalition with the Social Democrats – needed to be beaten back by an elite-led populist movement that would restore German conservatives to their former glory. The dream was to bring back good old-fashioned German values, but keep the settings of German economic dominance in place. As the political face of this movement, Diekmann favoured Merkel’s defence minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose impeccably aristocratic credentials and Ted-talk persona would make him the ideal patrician-tribune of Germany’s silent majority. But the dream collapsed in 2011, when Guttenberg fell into disgrace after it was discovered he had plagiarised his doctoral dissertation. Today, the man who was once due to make German conservatism great again runs an investment firm in Manhattan, and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Reichelt took over Bild in 2018, after his immediate predecessor, Tanit Koch, who tried to steer the paper in a more anodyne, Merkel-friendly direction, left the position. (Koch has spoken of her exit in cool terms, telling a German news website that she felt she did not have the support of the Axel Springer CEO.) Under Reichelt’s tenure, the paper quickly established itself as a battering ram against Merkel. Bild once again plays the game of guiding and reflecting public opinion on a host of questions. Among its enthusiasms are German cars and the arms industry. “At last! The Leopard-2 tank in Idlib and possibly soon in the fight against Assad’s Russian tanks (T-55, T-62, T-72 and T-90),” tweeted Bild’s political editor about recent events in Syria. “As always, it takes a Turk to use a German tank for what it was built for.”
In the higher echelons of German media, Reichelt is perhaps best known for his dogfights on Twitter, where, until recently at least, he spent a lot of time. “You never win anything on Twitter,” he told me, a bit mournfully, like a recovering addict. On the platform, Reichelt can still be relied upon to submit world events to the logic of the Marvel universe. “Runaway Ed” Snowden is “the hero of global terrorism”. Trump’s assassination of the Iranian military leader Qassem Suleimani “freed the world of a monster”.
There are a few non-populist positions Reichelt takes that have the appearance of principle. “He has staked out anti-Putin, pro-Nato, pro-Israel positions well beyond the standard German line,” says Niggemeier. But the majority of the paper’s content is an ever-shifting attempt to harness popular discontent rather than indoctrinate readers in any specific programme. Reichelt himself has, for instance, repeatedly come to Merkel’s defence on her decision not to close the border to Syrian refugees in 2015, describing it as an ethical “no-brainer”, but the paper goes to great lengths to associate migrants with crime, and to demand deportations. On the environment, one day Bild might be lamenting Merkel’s call to shutter coal factories by 2038 (“The coal deadline is going to cost us!” ran a headline about the prospective job losses.) But another day you might read that “Our government officials are destroying the environment!” atop an article detailing the 200,000 yearly flights German officials take between ministries in Berlin and Bonn. Like Merkel herself, Reichelt is an arch-opportunist, congenitally averse to letting crises go to waste.
Several German journalists I spoke to attributed Reichelt’s heightened focus on Bild’s politics to a desperate attempt to counteract falling readership numbers. One of Reichelt’s heroes, he told me, is Franz-Josef Strauss, a legendary conservative postwar politician, who was famous for his political mantra: “Never allow a party right of the Christian Social Union”. Bild’s competitors on its right today come from Breitbart-esque news blogs such as Politically Incorrect. Bild seems to have done its best to outflank these outlets by covering the same kinds of stories as them, often in much the same tone. In more than one case, these articles have been false. In 2017, the paper ran a story about a mob of Arab men assaulting women in a Frankfurt restaurant, which police subsequently confirmed never happened.
On the international front, Bild echoes the calls of prominent German centrist liberals who believe Germany must assume a leading role in world affairs. “You have this ongoing performance whereby they call for Germany to be in the middle of the action, but have no sense of responsibility for what that would entail,” says Blätter editor Albrecht von Lucke. “As soon as you have German troops deployed anywhere, even on the most humanitarian mission imaginable, who will be the first to cry out about it when the first guys fall in the war? Who will demand they come home and that it’s all been a mistake? Bild. You can count on that.” It is the same mentality that led one Bavarian AfD politician earlier this year to tweet against the banning of a beer festival because of Covid-19 – only to go on to sue the city of Rosenheim for the rise in cases after the beer festival did take place.
The coronavirus pandemic initially caught Bild – and the German right – off guard. After the government’s strong response to the crisis, Merkel seemed immune to criticism. Bild turned its focus to China. In April, Reichelt published a public letter demanding €149bn in reparations from Beijing for the economic impact of Covid-19. “You shut down every newspaper and website that is critical of your rule,” Reichelt wrote in the letter, “but not the stalls where bat soup is sold.” The stunt made headlines around the world, and predictably enraged the Chinese embassy in Berlin. (A more expansive version of Bild’s letter by Springer’s CEO, calling for the decoupling of western economies from China, appeared in Springer’s respectable daily, Die Welt.) It’s this willingness to play fast and loose with geopolitics, now in a populist vein, that makes Bild, according to von Lucke, “much more dangerous than it ever was before”. (Not that Bild neglected the domestic front. “Despite corona restrictions, 300 people gather at mosque for prayer”, read one headline in April. “Churches closed for fear of Ramadan-chaos,” ran another.)
When public impatience with closed schools and shops began to mount in late May, Bild, having failed to gain traction with its usual scapegoats, changed tack. Its new target was Germany’s leading virologist, Christian Drosten, who had become an unexpected celebrity thanks to his measured media interviews and his advisory role to Merkel’s government. On 25 May, one of Bild’s reporters sent him an email, claiming that other experts had serious criticisms of his latest study on Covid-19. The reporter demanded that Drosten respond within an hour. Instead, Drosten published the email on Twitter and said there that he had “better things to do”. The subsequent article, which tried to blow up minor statistical disagreements into a public assault on Drosten’s reputation, backfired drastically. The German mediasphere rallied to his defence: #Ichhabebessereszutun (#betterthingstodo) became a hashtag. Georg Streiter, a former deputy government spokesperson who also used to work at Bild and still praises the paper, called it a baseless smear campaign, and put the blame squarely on Reichelt. “It’s like dog owners,” he said. “The problem is usually at the top of the leash.”
“We’re read by more German professors than any other publication,” Reichelt told me when I visited his office in the Axel Springer building in Berlin last year. “We’re read by the businessmen and the workers – and if some read us for ironic reasons, well, that’s fine, too.”
The Springer building is a giant glass structure that towers over nearby restaurants and embassies. (A new Springer building, designed by Rem Koolhaas, which resembles a damaged glass cube, has been recently erected across the road.) Outside is a statue of a vaguely leprous-looking Axel Springer. A few streets over, extending more than five storeys up the side of the headquarters of Taz, the leftwing daily, stands another piece of Bild lore: a giant high-relief sculpture of Kai Diekmann’s penis. This ostentatious invasion of the former Bild editor’s privacy, unveiled in 2009, sprouted out of a long conflict that had begun seven years earlier, when Diekmann sued Taz for publishing a satirical article claiming he had undergone penis enhancement surgery in Miami. (At the time the judge ruled that, as the nation’s leading purveyor and profiteer of gossip, Diekmann must learn to live with this jab at this dignity.)
With its smartly dressed assistants and ample supply of alcohol, Bild’s headquarters in Berlin succeeds in transmitting a throwback aura. “In case there’s any doubt that I’m a real tabloid editor,” Reichelt said, flashing me his lighter with a naked woman on it, as he lit up a Gauloises Blue in his office. The room was strewn with Americana: a Kennedy photograph, a Reagan biography. On top of a pile of books lay a child’s car seat, next to a contemporary military-grade helmet that Reichelt wore when he covered the Syrian war for Springer. On the floor was a copy of the Financial Times. (“It repays the attention you give it every morning,” he told me. “It’s such a great product.”) I asked him why, in the past couple of years, Bild has reduced the number of naked women in the paper. “It wasn’t for any politically correct reason,” said Reichelt. “It’s just that when so much of your staff is female, and they’re all very professional, it just gets slightly awkward having to rank naked women with them day in and day out.”
For the daily editorial meeting, we entered a conference room, where about 12 staffers were seated around a long table, overlooking the Berlin skyline. “What have we got?” Reichelt asked. An image of Ursula von der Leyen was displayed on a big screen. “Can we give her a bit more brightness in her face?” asked one of the women at the table. “She looks a bit lugubrious.” “There we go, there we go – more gravitas now,” said another woman.
“What’s going on in that?” Reichelt said, looking at a photo of a musician wearing lederhosen and a high-and-tight haircut. Reichelt was munching on chocolate now. I had been told that Bild editorial meetings could be rough going, but this one was running smoothly.
“That’s the folk singer Andreas Gabalier,” said another man at the table. “He going to be awarded the Karl Valentin prize in Munich, but apparently he’s some kind of rightwing hardliner.”
“What’s he doing in the photo?” Reichelt asked.
“Apparently he’s contorted his body into the form of a swastika,” the man replied.
“I don’t quite see it,” Reichelt said.
“Couldn’t it just be a walk-like-an-Egyptian dance move there?”
“Yes, it’s all a bit unclear.”
“All right, we’ll just say that some people interpret it as a swastika.”
“OK, got it.”
“Anything on the crime front?” Reichelt asked.
“We’ve got a paedophile paediatrician who sexually abused young boys for 15 years.”
“What was the ruling on this guy?” Reichelt asked.
“Judge has put him away for ever.”
“Nice. Great judge. Can I see a photo of him?” A photo of a grey-haired man named Roland Christiani flashed up on the screen. “What a great face! He looks like a professor,” Reichelt said. “Let’s give him a bump in the headline.”
“How about ‘Judge locks paediatrician away for ever’?”
“I like it!” said Reichelt.
“Can I get a show of hands of how many of you are for the proposed speed limit?” Reichelt asked his lieutenants. Merkel’s government was threatening to impose a speed limit on German cars. A few hands went up. “God, it’s just like the country at large – we’re completely divided on this,” Reichelt said. “Why are you against it?” He trained his eyes on an editor.
“People just drive too fast. I’m tired of being scared on the autobahn when a car comes by doing 200km/h.”
“The trouble is that if you lower the speed limit I can’t make it to Hamburg in two hours any more,” another editor said.
“You drive to Hamburg in two hours? That’s insane: maybe there should be a limit,” Reichelt joked.
The trouble with the speed limit, Reichelt later told me in private, was that it interfered with the fundamental German ideal of freedom, which is that, within the rules, you can do what you want. “There are too many Germans now waking up to find that if they eat meat and love their car, they’re suddenly Nazis,” Reichelt said. “And that’s exactly how the German left speaks. They speak of their fellow citizens as criminals, as people committing crimes against future generations, and they even want to see if they can perhaps introduce punishments – to formally make this into a crime. But what about all those people who aren’t waiting for the delivery of their new Tesla?”
Next year will almost certainly be Merkel’s last as chancellor. She has already relinquished her position as the secretary of the CDU. When it came to the struggle to determine her successor last year – specifically, who would fill the role of secretary – Reichelt personally favoured the millionaire businessman Friedrich Merz over Merkel’s chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. But Reichelt hastened to point out that his favourites don’t get special treatment in Bild. “Did I want Merz to replace Merkel? Probably. Did we hesitate to [let him destroy himself]? No. Bild ran the interview that fatally damaged his campaign when he claimed he was a millionaire but still middle-class.” Reichelt said his newspaper had to be open to destroying reputations; this was a “most valuable weapon” that he would not sacrifice even for his own preferences.
With Merkel’s departure on the horizon, the fight is already brewing at the political centre, as German regional leaders try to outbid each other with the comprehensiveness of their coronavirus crackdowns in a headlong appeal to the aged voters who still determine German politics. In the face of this political future, Reichelt is sanguine. “Trump has shown that anything can happen – that’s just a fact,” he told me. “There is no reason that the future has to be dictated by Green parties and child protesters.”
But there seems little chance that Bild will be able to retrieve any viable vintage of German conservative leadership from the cellar. “We have to hope that the radicalisation of Bild, like the rise of autocrats around the world, represents the last gasp of patriarchal thinking,” says Tania Martini, a media critic for Taz. As Bild’s sputtering failure to derail Merkel and her scientists during the pandemic showed, the German public is largely unwilling at present to diverge from what it takes to be the steady course. Threats to Bild’s position as Merkel’s leading critic are closer to home: the most scathing recent critique of Merkel’s government has come from outside any established political platform, in the form of a blue-haired, 27-year-old internet influencer who castigated the German political establishment for its record on climate change, welfare, and migration in a 55-minute, copiously annotated YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 17m times.
The last time I saw Reichelt in his office, last summer, he wanted to talk about his preferred enemies. “There is Putin,” he told me. “He wants to weaken our German institutions and interfere with our elections. You know why? Because he knows he lives in a piece of shit country – that he has made his country into shit – and so he wants other countries to come down to his level so that his disastrous record can be less easily seen.”
Before he could get any further in his diatribe, a Bild reporter lunged into the office. “Piëch is dead,” he announced. The family owner of Porsche, Ferdinand Piëch, had apparently died.
“Really? Piëch?” Reichelt said. “How?”
“In a pizzeria,” said the reporter. “It seems it was a heart attack.”
“That’s fantastic. A pizza restaurant!”
“It seems so.”
“Can we get confirmation?” He suggested giving Gerhard Schröder a call.
“Sure, we’ll get confirmation.”
Piëch had not died in a pizzeria after all, we learned a few moments later, somewhat to Reichelt’s annoyance. But then he quickly picked back up the thread. “Then we have the spineless left at home, that just wants to let Putin and Assad run roughshod over the whole liberal western order. They want to bring the German car industry to a screeching halt, freeze rents in Berlin, starve the economy and keep Germany from doing anything in the world. I remember meeting with some people here in the defence ministry when I got back from covering the war in Syria. Let’s build a no-fly zone in northern Syria, I said. Let’s go do it alone if we have to. But no one in Germany with power knows how to use it – or even wants to use it.”
“What about Bild?” I asked.
“With Bild,” Reichelt smiled, “it’s the other way around.”

When Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit as Germany’s chancellor, in 2005, she joined Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and leaders from central and eastern Europe that had joined the bloc only 17 months earlier. Nearly 15 years later, Merkel is the EU’s longest-serving leader and seen as the key to unlocking a deal to help Europe face the worst economic slump forecast in its history.
A year ago Merkel was seen as tired and drifting, having announced her intention to stand down as chancellor in 2021 after disastrous election results. Now credited for her calm leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, with personal approval ratings close to 80%, she is once again seen as the indispensable broker as EU leaders seek a recovery plan.
“Merkel was strengthened by coronavirus and by not being challenged inside her party,” said a senior EU diplomat. “I think that she is ready [to get a deal], she understands every small thing about the proposals.”
When EU leaders sit down together on Friday and Saturday, it will be their first face-to-face meeting since the pandemic struck. On the table is a €750bn (£680bn) draft recovery plan, as well as a proposed €1.074tn EU budget for the next seven years. Getting a deal on the budget will be fiendishly difficult as the EU attempts to square the circle of more spending on the environment, security and health and the €75bn shortfall caused by Brexit.
Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said Merkel would play a crucial role both because she was “so respected for her work” and because Germany was taking a middle position in the recovery plan, giving it a foot in both camps.
She said Germany had “a very strong commitment … to really invest heavily in the recovery of the EU,” but demands from northern countries to link funds to economic reform were “something that is very close to the German heart as well”.
Optimistic officials are encouraged by the coincidence that Germany took on the EU council’s rotating presidency on 1 July, amid sniping about the performance of the leaders of EU institutions. Charles Michel, the European council president, tasked with brokering a compromise, has been criticised by some for his handling of budget talks. “He is still paralysed by the failure of the European council in February,” said one senior EU diplomat.
An EU official responded that Michel had fully prepared for that February summit, but the task had not been easy as some EU leader were unprepared to compromise. “Since then we have had a global pandemic landing on our doorstep and the world has changed completely.”
Germany opened the way to a recovery plan with its own political conversion, enshrined in the deal Merkel struck with France’s Emmanuel Macron for a fund based on grants to countries hardest hit by coronavirus. Pierre Sellal, who spent a decade as France’s most senior diplomat in Brussels, said Merkel had crossed two of Germany’s traditional red lines; “The first, no deficits, no common borrowing. And secondly, no transformation of the rules underpinning in the single currency, no budgetary transfers.”
The Germany presidency could crystallise a consensus, he said. “Now we are at a very particular moment, the stakes are very high.”
Germany’s readiness to accept large-scale EU borrowing contrasts with the stance Merkel took during the eurozone debt crisis, when she stood firmly against a transfer union. The German government “realised that its own approach doesn’t allow the necessary convergence and cohesion in the EU,” said Schwarzer, who highlighted the role of Germany’s Social Democrat finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as architect of the policy shift. Schwarzer said Germany’s change of heart was “not out of some kind of abstract idea of solidarity – but it’s really in Germany’s self-interest to do so.”
Since Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US – two hammer blows to the European project – all EU leaders have become more aware of their economic interdependence and the risks of the European single market unravelling. “Thanks to Brexit … suddenly the leaders say we will defend the single market,” said a second senior EU diplomat, who also cited Trump and tensions in the EU-China relationship. As political frost descends on global trade, what was once seen as Germany’s strength, its export-led economy, suddenly looked more like a vulnerability.
Merkel’s change of heart has weakened the “frugal four”, a quartet of northern European states that want less EU spending and more budget discipline. For months, Germany had been perceived as an unofficial member. Now they stand more isolated.
But EU officials caution that Germany’s policy shift is not enough for agreement, as the frugal four continue to insist on tough conditions for loans that southern European governments reject as unacceptable. “Even having the Franco-German proposal is not always helpful, said one official. “We are playing chess on many different levels.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, shop steward of the frugal four, said on Tuesday he was “not hopeful” of a deal.
The other big obstacle comes from the leader second only to Merkel in years running his country: Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister is resisting plans to tie the disbursement of EU funds to the rule of law, a key demand for western European governments alarmed about the weakening of democratic checks and balances in Hungary. Orbán got a symbolic boost from lawmakers in his Fidesz party this week who passed a resolution declaring that EU funds should not be linked to “political or ideological conditions – under the label of rule of law”.
Solving this political Rubik’s cube is now bound up with the political legacy of the German chancellor, who told MEPs this month: “The top priority in the Germany presidency will be unity in Europe.”

With Trump’s US missing in action from the global stage, the European Union should be stepping into the vacuum. Germany, which has just taken over the bloc’s rotating presidency, could use the next six months to provide the leadership to boost Europe’s global impact. But is it ready to shake off its traditional reticence?
Immediate economic challenges will dominate EU leaders’ first in-person encounter since the lockdown, on 17 and 18 July. And Berlin is right to prioritise agreement on the EU’s new seven-year budget and a pandemic recovery plan, a task complicated by internal rifts and new forecasts warning of an even deeper recession than expected across the 27-nation bloc. As Angela Merkel said in a recent Guardian interview: “For Europe to survive, its economy needs to survive.”
But Europe’s recovery is conditional on the state of the global economy. And without the US at its side, the EU is struggling to revive faltering multilateral commitments to health, keep up the pressure to meet global climate targets and fight against trade protectionism.
As a bloc it must accept the US retreat and grab the mantle of global leadership because, diminished as it is, multilateralism has never been so needed. Germany is in the right place at the right time to give a powerful boost to this endeavour. Not only is Merkel’s government chairing the EU, it has a two-year stint as a (non-permanent) member of the UN security council until 31 December.
Europe already has the regulatory and market power as well as the multilateral credentials to matter worldwide. EU officials have recently organised two fundraising events for Covid-19 vaccine research and the bloc is trying to bolster both the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization, key multilateral institutions bruised and battered by US-China rivalries and, in the case of the WHO, by the US decision to formally withdraw from the organisation.
Yet, in its EU presidency programme, Berlin modestly promises to assume “considerable responsibility” to help shape the global order. It has also presented a laudable but impossibly long list of “key priorities”.
This is a recipe for failure. The EU will not, for instance, be able to bring peace to the Middle East, however hard it tries. The US has torpedoed EU attempts to strike a nuclear deal with Iran and internal divisions complicate EU-Russia relations. Merkel will have to be selective in deciding just when, where and how the EU acts, both at home and abroad.
The first step is for Berlin and Brussels to wean themselves off their over-dependence on the US, a fact recognised by Merkel. The quandary isn’t Europe’s alone. As the chancellor underlined, a world that grew up in the “certain knowledge” that the US was a global power now has to adjust to a new reality.
EU discussions on the principle of “strategic autonomy” are a step in the right direction. Initially associated with security and defence, strategic autonomy is now also being sought on trade, foreign investment and a post-pandemic focus on reshoring supply chains linked to essential medical products.
Second, while the EU’s focus is unrelentingly on its volatile relationship with China, its global standing hinges also on upgrading relations with other Asian economic giants, including Japan, India and Indonesia.
Third, Europe must re-imagine its outdated relationship with Africa, learn from past mistakes and finally give up old-fashioned Eurocentric and paternalistic views of Africa as a junior partner needing Europe’s guidance. New EU efforts to build “a partnership of equals” with African states will fall flat unless backed up by investment, support for the African Continental Free Trade Area and stronger ties between European and African local and regional authorities, business leaders, civil society, female groups, young professionals and students.
Fourth, the EU’s reputation, especially as a human rights defender, is tarred by its weak responses on migration and populism. Greece, currently accused of pushing back asylum-seekers at the border with Turkey and preventing refugee boats from reaching EU waters, isn’t the only country suspected of violating migrants’ rights.
Ursula von der Leyen, the EU commission president, has said she wants a “fresh start” via a new migration pact but that has now been put off until autumn as officials seek to win over recalcitrant leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. A tendency in Europe to speak of migration and security in the same breath also needs to change, especially in view of evidence of the growing threat posed by far-right extremism, also in Germany.
In the end, the EU needs to showcase its unique leadership qualities for a changed and changing world. Covid-19 has demonstrated the weakness of strongmen and populists. Complex challenges can’t be tackled by reliance on a sole global policeman but require actions by a changing constellation of state and non-state actors working in different formats and at different times. Hard power may still matter to those engaged in real wars but it’s the EU’s quiet diplomacy and strong adherence to the rule of law that count for many others.
In an increasingly cantankerous world Germany can make sure EU governments practise at home what they preach abroad. Above the clamour of great power struggles and zero-sum games, Berlin can steer its EU partners to stop looking in the rear-view mirror and to embrace instead a more interesting, if less predictable, future.

Lockdown has proved challenging for most workplaces, and the European Council is no different. All-night sessions, corridor huddles and fine dining in the glass Europa building in Brussels have been replaced with hours staring at a gallery of fellow heads of state reading out prepared lines in front of a backdrop of EU and national flags – and the odd bit of pop art, as in the case of Luxembourg’s prime minister Xavier Bettel.
But this week, leaders will be forced to switch off their laptops and make their way across recently reopened borders to Brussels for their first face-to-face meeting in five months – and it is set to be a bruising encounter.
With the continent heading into a recession not seen since the 1930s, the EU’s institutional heads, the presidents of the European commission and council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, have struggled to find consensus between sparring member states over both a long-term budget and a huge one-off economic stimulus. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French president, Emmanuel Macron, have given their backing to a €750bn (£675bn) pandemic recovery fund. But “frugal” northern states have raised issues. Efforts to placate them have angered Hungary’s nationalist prime minister and the European parliament.
“It became obvious deals weren’t going to be made online,” said one EU official. “You need the work in the margins, bilaterals and discussions between advisers to find the common ground. It needed a physical meeting.”
But the set-up will be far from normal this weekend. The usual back-slapping and cheek-kissing will be replaced by social distancing in the presence of mask-wearing aides. The army of reporters that flock to the summits has also been banned from taking the usual seats in the expansive foyer of the Justus Lipsius building next door to the Europa.
The European commission forecasts an 8.3% drop in economic activity across the EU this year followed by a 5.8% rebound in 2021 but countries are expected to emerge from the crisis at starkly different speeds, risking a breakdown in the bloc’s single market as the disparity between Europe’s haves and have-nots is exacerbated
In Brussels’ latest proposal, Michel, a former Belgian prime minister said to have had a lacklustre first year in his role chairing leaders’ debates, only appeared to stir up new problems.
In response to the unapologetically “frugal” positions taken by Mark Rutte, the Netherlands’ prime minister, Michel tabled a €25bn smaller seven-year budget than last proposed, through which day-to-day programmes including the common agricultural policy are funded.
He also suggested greater accountability for countries seeking cash from the separate recovery pot, which is to be partly financed through issuing joint EU debt. But the move to placate the Dutch ended up annoying Hungary and Europe’s parliament.
One of the big tasks facing Brussels is bridging the demand for financial relief from countries such as Italy and Spain, whose economies are in freefall due to the pandemic, and maintaining the faith of sceptical taxpayers in the richer north. “Are European governments ready for their business to be our business?” asked one EU diplomat from a northern state.
We need a strong budget and if you want to deal with the future challenges you need to invest
Confirming EU officials’ predictions that the leaders faced a “very difficult” meeting, with doleful diplomats fearful that the talks starting on Friday will drag on into Sunday, Michel’s plan to find the right balance drew immediate fire from countries outside the “frugal four” of the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria, who have hitherto made Michel’s life difficult by demanding less spending and tighter controls.
Following Michel’s suggestion that the commission be joined by the European court of auditors, the EU’s financial watchdog, in reporting on the governance of member states seeking recovery cash, and making funding conditional on backing from a qualified majority of member states, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán was first to go on the attack.
Speaking on state-owned Kossuth Rádió, Orbán threatened to scupper both the long-term budget and the recovery fund if “rule of law” strings were attached to funds, telling reporters “there will not be an economic restart, there will not be a budget, there will be drawn-out debates”.
“Let’s put this debate aside now,” Orbán said. “Let’s resolve the economic problems, restart our economies, start creating jobs, then we can continue the rule of law debates.”
Hungary and Poland could be big winners from the recovery fund but are facing proceedings over concerns that changes to their judicial systems have undermined the independence of their judges and breach EU treaties.
There was also rejection of Michel’s proposals from the European parliament’s negotiators, who disapprove of cuts to the budget known as the multi-annual financial framework.
Both the budget and recovery fund have to be approved by MEPs. A cross-party group has been tasked with finding a package that can command a majority in the chamber. The European parliament has strongly advocated a significantly larger budget for the bloc than Michel’s proposal of €1.074tn over seven years.
Rasmus Andresen, a Green MEP who is the only German budget negotiator for the parliament, told the Observer that Michel’s proposal would be swiftly voted down if it came to the chamber. He said: “We need a strong budget and if you want to deal with the future challenges you need to invest and it is not enough to have a recovery fund for three or four years.
There is a lot of criticism in the parliament and it will be much louder when colleagues are analysing what it means.”
If this week’s meeting fails to find common ground, a second has been pencilled in for the last week of July, with Merkel insisting the EU must resolve the problem by the summer.
Rutte – whose country would benefit from Michel’s proposed retention of its budget rebate and €5bn reserve set aside should the UK end its relationship with the EU without a new deal – said he would “handle” any criticism at this week’s summit.
“I’m not made of marzipan,” he said. “It is starting to go our way.”

Martin Kettle is absolutely right in his comparison between Germany’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and that of the UK (On different planets: how Germany tackled the pandemic, and Britain flailed, 24 June). But one big factor is the fact that Germany is not, as he writes, just “a bit more prosperous” than Britain. Its standard of living is much higher than ours and there is certainly less of a divide between the rich and poor than there is here. The much higher standards of hygiene in Germany and of health care have also been an important contributing factor to the country’s much lower Covid-19 infection and death rates.
Our government of Little Englanders and fanatical privateers will never admit that we could learn something from another nation, let alone from Germany. Angela Merkel has pursued a politics of consensus and moderation, whereas our Conservatives have consistently followed the discredited neoliberalism of the US and the chaotic response to this pandemic is a direct result.John GreenLondon
• Martin Kettle’s excellent analysis of why the UK’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak is so much worse than Germany’s segues into a critique of the general condition of delusional arrogance that infects this country’s ruling class. It calls to mind Tolstoy’s comparison in War and Peace of the reasons why each of the major European nations is self-assured.
The English come off best: “An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best organised state in the world, and therefore always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct.” We are now the sick man of Europe because the first part of this statement has long since ceased to be true, while the second, alas, hasn’t.Emeritus Professor Glyn TurtonBaildon, West Yorkshire
• Twenty years ago, the British Academy set up a working party to inquire into the quality of the teaching of modern languages in Britain, compared with other European countries. The main finding was (to borrow Martin Kettle’s phrase) that British quality was trailing not world-beating. Our working party looked at technology teaching in British schools and compared it with the state of technical high schools in Germany. Trailing, or being beaten? Plus ça change?Jinty NelsonLondon

As Europe emerges from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, it faces challenges on an epic scale.
In Italy and Spain, the spectre of spiralling, unsustainable debt jeopardises recovery in economies that were already fragile. In Brussels, there is concern that amid the post-pandemic fallout, the generational task of addressing the climate emergency and implementing tough green targets will be put to one side. Europe’s place in a newly multi-polar world, dominated by the increasingly tense rivalry between the United States and China, must be worked out anew. Post-epidemic, there is a new emphasis on economic self-sufficiency, particularly in medical manufacturing and key industries. The European Union’s future trading relationship with Britain needs to be agreed in a matter of months.
In a context this formidable, it is the EU’s good fortune that Germany, the largest and most powerful member state, will take over its rotating presidency this week. For obvious reasons of history, Germany has traditionally been reluctant to punch its weight on the European stage. But extraordinary times demand clear leadership. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, appears determined to provide it. Outlining her plans for the presidency recently, Ms Merkel told German MPs that: “Europe needs us, just as we need Europe.” Brexit trade talks are likely to be treated as one dimension of a bigger problem: shoring up the single market during a period of economic turmoil.
In an interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers this weekend, Ms Merkel made it clear that her most urgent priority will be to reach swift agreement on a €750bn post-coronavirus recovery fund, to be financed by EU-issued debt and distributed to countries in the form of grants rather than loans.
Signing off on this innovation, first proposed by Ms Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in May, would be a landmark moment. The prospect of pooling debt with impecunious southern neighbours has traditionally been anathema to the EU’s more prosperous member states, with the resistance usually led by Germany. A so-called Frugal Four – Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands – will mount a fierce rearguard action to water the plan down. But the searing experience of the last three months appears to have changed perceptions in Berlin of what is possible and desirable.
Domestically, a sacrosanct commitment to balanced budgets has been put to one side to allow a gigantic stimulus package and state bailouts. At a European level, Ms Merkel believes a step-change in solidarity is required. She has rightly warned that a failure to take collective action to stabilise Europe’s reeling economies will play into the hands of anti-democratic and authoritarian forces.
The tone and approach are strikingly different from a decade ago, when Ms Merkel and her then finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, helped enforce EU-wide austerity measures in the wake of the financial crash. But during her 15-year stint as chancellor, Ms Merkel has demonstrated a peerless ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Before Covid-19 struck, she was viewed as a lame-duck leader, having announced her intention to stand down in 2021. Instead, Germany’s assured handling of the epidemic has enhanced her authority and provided the political capital to take necessary risks in what has become a crisis presidency. Germany has sometimes been criticised for “leading from behind”. For the next six months, Ms Merkel will be leading from the front. For the EU, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, that is good news.

Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has hit out at world leaders for wanting to be pictured with her to “look good”.
The 17-year-old became a global star thanks to her activism, and gave a powerful speech at the United Nations climate change summit in September in which she told world leaders: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words … how dare you!”
As part of a series she has made about her campaigning for Swedish radio during the coronavirus lockdown, Thunberg revealed that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had queued up to have a “selfie” with the teenager at the international gathering in New York.
On the radio programme, she was critical of the way high-ranking figures had behaved after her UN appearance.
She said: “Presidents, prime ministers, kings and princesses came and wanted to talk to me.
“They saw me and suddenly saw the chance that they could take a photo with me for their Instagram account. Then the hashtag #savetheplanet.
“It seemed as if they had forgotten for a moment to be ashamed that their generation had let future generations down.”
In follow-up comments made to the BBC, Thunberg, who has more than 4m Twitter followers, said she had a “dislike” for politicians who wanted to capitalise on her fame by being photographed alongside her.
“To be fair, it was not only her, it was many,” she said, when asked about the situation with Merkel.
“And those kinds of things happen all the time. People just want to stand next to me and other climate activists.
“They can post it on social media and it makes them look good, it makes them seem like they care.”
In January, Thunberg was pictured with Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, after he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Thunberg did not refer to Charles, a longstanding environmentalist, when making her comments, however.
When asked if global leaders vying for picture opportunities made her feel “used”, the founder of the school strike for climate movement said: “Yes, people definitely see me sometimes as someone to stand next to, to look good, and that is something I really dislike because that’s not the sort of person I want to be.”
During the 25-minute interview, Thunberg said she hoped that the changes made by governments and people across the globe in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic would help to change the perception around the action required to tackle global warming.
The advocate has previously slammed the UK’s declining carbon emissions figures as “creative accounting” and has pushed for firmer action to be taken.
“If anything it [coronavirus] will change the way we perceive and treat crises because it shows that during a crisis you act with necessary force,” she told the BBC.
“And it has also opened up the discussion around how much we value human life.
“For example, people say they are ready to sacrifice the economy. They are saying we will do what it takes because we cannot put a price on a human life.
“If you introduce that logic for the climate, for instance, then that opens up many possibilities and it changes the discussion of the debate.”
• This article was amended on 30 June 2020 to correct the name of the climate movement: it is “school strike” not “schools strike”.
… we’re all in. Are you? On November 4, a day after the presidential election, the US will formally withdraw from the Paris agreement on constraining global heating. It’s urgent that we tell the world what this means, and the Guardian is pulling out all the stops to do so. Will you help us by supporting our journalism?

 in the last year. And you’re not alone; millions are flocking to the Guardian every day. Financial support from our readers is crucial in enabling us to produce open, fearless, independent reporting that addresses the climate emergency. It helps sustain the freedom we have to present the facts comprehensively, explain the details as they unfold, and interrogate the decisions made.

The Guardian recognises the climate emergency as the defining issue of our times. That’s why we have pledged to give climate change, wildlife extinction and pollution the sustained attention and prominence they demand, as a core part of our journalism.

At this pivotal moment for our planet, our independence enables us to always inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific fact, not political prejudice or business interests. This makes us different. And we are equally determined to practice what we preach: we have divested from the oil and gas sectors, renounced fossil fuel advertising and committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.

We believe everyone deserves access to information that is fact-checked, and analysis that has authority and integrity. That’s why, unlike many others, we made a choice: to keep Guardian reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. Our work would not be possible without our readers, who now support our work from 180 countries around the world.

As the rotating presidency of the EU council passes to Germany on 1 July, the country’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, sat down for an interview with the Guardian and five other European newspapers – Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, France’s Le Monde, Spain’s La Vanguardia, Italy’s La Stampa and Poland’s Polityka – to talk about Europe’s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, her stance on the Brexit negotiations, and global challenges posed by the US, Russia and China.
Germany’s European council presidency is taking place during an unprecedented crisis. There is a lot of pressure; Germany is expected to sort things out. How nervous are you?
My first council presidency as chancellor was in 2007. The European constitutional treaty had just been rejected in France and the Netherlands, and we had set ourselves the task of shaping a new treaty. We succeeded in that. Then came the international financial crisis, turbulence for the euro and the refugee issue – so difficult times are nothing new. And time and again it has been shown that Europe is not yet sufficiently resistant to crises. In the euro crisis, we lacked the tools for an appropriate response. The movements of refugees in 2015 showed up the deficiencies of the EU asylum system.
Now the coronavirus pandemic is confronting us with a challenge of unprecedented dimensions. It has struck us all indiscriminately. On the one hand, it has torn us away from a period of positive economic development in all EU member states. On the other hand, it has coincided with the two great disruptive phenomena of our time, climate change and the digital revolution, which are changing our lives and our economies regardless of the virus. I am very sharply focused on all of this.
Given the sheer number of crises, is the EU’s survival on the line?
Rather than ask the existential question too often, we should get on with the day job. It is very much in all the member states’ own interests to maintain a strong European internal market and to stand united on the world stage. In such an extraordinary situation, I rely on the member states having a great interest in the things that unite us.
The crisis has not just struck Europe; the whole world is fighting the pandemic as well as political demons.
Exactly, and it is true that the tone of international discourse is brusque at the moment. After the 2008 financial crisis, multilateralism was the order of the day. That was when the G20 started meeting at the level of heads of state or government, and the countries gave a very unified response. That is not the case today. These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example. I am counting on it – though I am under no illusions about how difficult the negotiations will be.
Your proposal for a recovery fund was a major concession to the southern countries. What reform efforts are you expecting in return?
I don’t find it helpful to talk about the northern countries, the southern countries and the eastern Europeans. That is seeing things in black and white. I expect each of us always to put ourselves in the other person’s shoes and consider problems from the other’s point of view.
The group known as the ‘frugal four’ is pursuing a defensive approach. Why has Germany left the cautious camp?
For Italy and Spain, for example, the coronavirus pandemic signifies a huge burden in economic, medical and, of course, because of the many lives lost, emotional terms. In these circumstances, it is only right for Germany to think not just about itself but to be prepared to engage in an extraordinary act of solidarity. It was in that spirit that French President Emmanuel Macron and I made our proposal.
Going into higher levels of debt is a U-turn for Germany. What happened to the chancellor with the tight purse strings?
In a crisis of this magnitude, each and every one of us is expected to do what needs to be done. What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that.
And all this is in our own interests too, of course. It is in Germany’s interest to have a strong internal market and to have the European Union grow closer together, not fall apart. As ever, what’s good for Europe is good for us.
The recovery fund has generated an odd kind of harmony. Is the money drawing a veil over the real problems of burgeoning nationalism and latent populism?
The recovery fund cannot solve all of Europe’s problems. But not having it would make all our problems worse. Europe’s economic health can influence so many things. Very high unemployment in a country can become politically explosive and thereby increase the threat to democracy. For Europe to survive, its economy needs to survive.
Might the recovery fund spark movement towards a United States of Europe?
I see this fund as a unique response to a unique situation. If we wanted to change fundamental aspects of the way the EU budget is managed or, for instance, give it the right to raise taxes, then we would have to amend the treaties. That would alter the static equilibrium between competence and oversight. I am sure this will be discussed in the years ahead, but that should be done cautiously. In the current situation, however, we could not wait for the treaties to be amended. We have to respond quickly to the pandemic.
Do you think Nadia Calviño [Spain’s economic affairs minister] would make a good Eurogroup president?
The finance ministers are discussing that at the moment. It is no secret that there is support for Nadia Calviño’s candidature in the German government. But the final decision lies with the Eurogroup. I am always pleased when women get leading political roles, and the Eurogroup has never been headed by a woman. But it’s not my decision. This is for the Eurogroup to decide.
Should Italy use what the European stability mechanism has to offer?
That is Italy’s decision to make. We have created these instruments through the EIB [the European Investment Bank]: the ESM with its precautionary credit lines and the Sure short-time work scheme. Anyone can make use of them. We didn’t make them available for them to remain unused.
You are the last head of government left of the 1989 generation. You experienced the eastern bloc and European unification. Is it not the case that Europe is drifting apart in spite of the pandemic-related efforts? Can the younger heads of government still find a common language?
Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was already politically active in 1989 too. Back then, the liberal democratic order had initially triumphed over the dictatorship of socialism and communism. But that was only part of the reality. Conflicts broke out in the western Balkans and later in the Islamic world. China rose to become a major economic power. Indeed, the example of China shows that even an undemocratic state can be economically successful, which is a major challenge for our liberal democracies. Then came the challenge of Islamist terrorism, particularly the attack on the United States of 11 September 2001. Add to this the disappointment that followed the Arab spring. In short, we have not yet been able to furnish absolute proof that the liberal system is about to win the day. That worries me.
Has Europe not reaped the benefits of its revolution?
Yes and no. On the one hand, we have enjoyed an incredible success story since 1989, but in our euphoria we failed to fully realise what long-term traces dictatorships had left in the 40 years since the second world war. After national socialism and the second world war, many countries in eastern Europe went straight into a second period of dictatorship. The countries of the eastern bloc had only a few years to develop their own national identities. So only later did they undergo processes that had long been part of normal life in western countries.
Many young EU accession countries share our enthusiasm for the European Union as a work of peace on the one hand, yet display scepticism towards Europe on the other. We need to develop understanding for that. I see my job as working for a self-determined, liberal Europe rooted in the fundamental rights of the individual.
With all due respect to differences of historical experience, where do you draw the line on violating the rule of law?
We will, of course, talk about issues relating to the rule of law. The hallmark of democracy is that any opposition must have a fair chance of returning to government. An opposition must be guaranteed a clear set of rights – starting with appropriate speaking time in parliaments and at least the same amount of airtime from public broadcasters, and extending to an independent judiciary and adherence to democratic rules.
Is European legislation now in breach of national legislation – or vice versa? Doesn’t the European legal system ultimately need to have more weight than national ones as a matter of principle?
It’s not as if this topic was never talked about before the federal constitutional court issued its judgment on the European Central Bank. Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law – but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends. The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German parliament does. That’s what we are seeing in the ECB case.
If the constitutional court finds that a boundary has been crossed, it goes to the European court of justice and requests a review. Up until now, all disagreements have been settled. Now we have a conflict. That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen.
The presidency wanted to find a joint strategy for dealing with China. Is that still realistic?
Because of the pandemic, we cannot hold the summit with China in September as planned. But we intend to hold it later. Its objective is to advance EU-Chinese relations. We share common interests, such as cooperating on climate action. We have been negotiating an investment agreement for some time but are not really moving forward on that. We should discuss our development policies in Africa, where China is following a different path in some areas.
At the same time, the summit is forcing us to develop a joint European position vis-à-vis China. That is no easy task. We should develop a policy that reflects our interests and values. After all, respect for human rights, the rule of law and our concerns about the future of Hong Kong stand between China and ourselves and are addressed openly.
Is China calling the western, democratic edifice of Europe into question?
We should start by doing everything we can to make ourselves more resilient. We need to stand together as Europeans, otherwise we will only weaken ourselves. China has become a global player. That makes us partners in economic cooperation and combating climate change, but also competitors with very different political systems. Not to talk to each other would certainly be a bad idea.
A no-deal Brexit is looming at the end of the year. Would that be a personal defeat for you?
No. It would, of course, be in Britain’s and all EU member states’ interests to achieve an orderly departure. But that can only happen if it is what both sides want. What matters is not our wishes but only the reality before us, in other words first of all what Britain wants. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves. It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy. If Britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the EU, our relations will be less close. That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines.
We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want. That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU27, will respond appropriately.
The United States has also been rushing to loosen its bonds with Europe. President Trump criticises Germany and wants to withdraw troops. Are you impressed by that threat?
We believe that the alliance is of great value to each of its members. We in Germany know that we have to spend more on defence; we have achieved considerable increases in recent years, and we will continue on that path to enhance our military capabilities. American troops in Germany help to protect not only Germany and the European part of Nato but also the interests of the United States of America.
Has the time come for the EU to gain strategic autonomy and actual sovereignty?
Look at the world; look at China or India. There are compelling reasons to remain committed to a transatlantic defence community and our shared nuclear umbrella. But of course Europe needs to carry more of the burden than during the cold war. We grew up in the certain knowledge that the United States wanted to be a world power. Should the US now wish to withdraw from that role of its own free will, we would have to reflect on that very deeply.
In eastern Europe in particular, the threat emanating from Russia is felt very strongly. Is Germany underestimating that threat?
We recognise misinformation campaigns; the weapons of hybrid warfare, as it is called, are part of Russia’s arsenal …
… even a murder, apparently …
… the murder in Berlin’s Tiergarten park is a serious incident, obviously, the blame for which is currently being ascertained in court. At any rate, we recognise hybrid warfare, methods of destabilisation, as a Russian behaviour pattern. On the other hand, there are good reasons to keep engaging in constructive dialogue with Russia. In countries like Syria and Libya, countries in Europe’s immediate neighbourhood, Russia’s strategic influence is great. I will therefore continue to strive for cooperation."

The rest of the world can no longer take it for granted that the US still aspires to be a global leader and needs to readjust its priorities accordingly, Angela Merkel has warned.
“We grew up in the certain knowledge that the United States wanted to be a world power,” the German chancellor said in an interview with a group of six European newspapers, including the Guardian.
“Should the US now wish to withdraw from that role of its own free will, we would have to reflect on that very deeply.”
Merkel, the first German leader to have grown up on the eastern side of the iron curtain, has in the past frequently spoken of her admiration for the US’s global influence. When she spoke in front of Congress in 2009, Merkel rhapsodised about the “incredible gift of freedom” bestowed on eastern Germans with the US-supported toppling of the Berlin Wall.
But even during Barack Obama’s presidency Merkel saw her government repeatedly chided for its low military spending – criticism that intensified under Donald Trump, who recently confirmed plans to withdraw 9,500 American troops from bases in Germany.
In an interview with the Guardian, Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, France’s Le Monde, Spain’s La Vanguardia, Italy’s La Stampa and Poland’s Polityka, Merkel said the US military presence in central Europe was in the US’s own interest.
“American troops in Germany help to protect not only Germany and the European part of NATO but also the interests of the United States of America,” the chancellor said.
Talking of Germany’s military spending, Merkel said: “We in Germany know that we have to spend more on defence; we have achieved considerable increases in recent years, and we will continue on that path to enhance our military capabilities.”
But “reflecting very deeply” for Merkel does not appear to amount to an endorsement of what the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called European “strategic autonomy”, the ability to defend the continent without reliance on the US.
“Look at the world; look at China or India,” Merkel said. “There are compelling reasons to remain committed to a transatlantic defence community and our shared nuclear umbrella. But of course Europe needs to carry more of the burden than during the cold war.”
Asked if Germany underestimated the threat posed by Russia, Merkel acknowledged a pattern of belligerent behaviour, citing “misinformation campaigns” and the murder of the Chechen exile Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin, which German prosecutors accuse Moscow of having ordered.
“The murder in Berlin’s Tiergarten park is a serious incident, obviously, the blame for which is currently being ascertained in court”, the chancellor said. “At any rate, we recognise hybrid warfare, methods of destabilisation, as a Russian behaviour pattern.”
“On the other hand, there are good reasons to keep engaging in constructive dialogue with Russia. In countries like Syria and Libya, countries in Europe’s immediate neighbourhood, Russia’s strategic influence is great. I will therefore continue to strive for cooperation.”"

The UK will have to “live with the consequences” of Boris Johnson ditching Theresa May’s plan to maintain close economic ties with the EU after Brexit, Angela Merkel has said, hardening her tone over the prospect of a no-deal scenario at the end of the year.
After more than three years in which the German chancellor repeatedly emphasised her openness to a deal that would maintain the UK’s current flows of trade with the bloc, she suggested the door leading to such a compromise had now closed.
“We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want,” Merkel said in a wide-ranging interview with a small group of European newspapers, including the Guardian. “That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU27, will respond appropriately.”
Speaking days before Germany takes over the EU rotating presidency, Merkel made clear that her priority was instead to push through a pandemic rescue plan to stop Europe’s economy sliding into the worst slump since the 1930s.
Coming in the week of the fourth anniversary of the Brexit referendum, the change of rhetoric from within the chancellory also appears to quash renewed speculation in the British press that Merkel could seek to soften Brussels’ red lines to secure a last-minute deal.
“With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves,” Merkel said. “It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.
“If Britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the EU, our relations will be less close. That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines.”
Negotiations between the UK and EU are in deadlock over whether Britain needs to tie itself to the EU’s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards in return for a zero-tariff trade deal.
Merkel’s ambassador in Brussels, Michael Clauss, recently said he expected Brexit to command most of the political attention in the autumn, fanning British hopes that Germany’s six-month EU council presidency could push the negotiations back to the top of the political agenda before the extension period ends on 31 December.
After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.
The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.
With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.
The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain.
Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.
It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.
Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in “embryo”. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher.
Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.
Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.
A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people"".
Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.

David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party
The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister
After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.
But in the interview, held around the enormous circular conference table inside Merkel’s chancellory in order to meet physical distancing rules, the German leader vowed to spend most of her political energy during the presidency on rallying EU member states around a joint economic response to “a challenge of unprecedented dimensions” posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The coronavirus crisis, which comes in the 15th and final full year of Merkel’s stint at the top of German politics, has not just led to a remarkable upswing for her personal approval ratings, but also an extraordinary pivot away from her conservative party’s deeply ingrained fiscal restraint.
On 18 May, Merkel surprised even party colleagues in her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) by teaming up with Emmanuel Macron to push for a European recovery fund worth €500bn (£448bn).
In front of journalists from the Europa group of newspapers, including the Guardian, Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, France’s Le Monde, Spain’s La Vanguardia, Italy’s La Stampa and Poland’s Polityka, Merkel said Germany was right to be prepared for “an extraordinary act of solidarity”.
“In a crisis of this magnitude, each and every one of us is expected to do what needs to be done. What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that.”
Her goal, Merkel said, was for the EU’s response to eventually match the multilateral response to the 2008 financial crisis. “These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example.”
Merkel and Macron’s initiative faces resistance from Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Even if they can sway the “frugal four”, in the coming months there is likely to be a scramble for access to recovery package funds.
“Because of the different degrees of damage inflicted by the pandemic, the distribution has to be based on a different formula from the one applied to normal European budgets,” said Merkel. “I hope that this argument will be accepted. This unusual challenge requires us to take an unusual path.
“For countries which are already heavily in debt, more borrowing makes less sense than grants. I am working to convince the remaining countries which have so far been in favour of loans but against grants.”
Some suggest Merkel’s seeming reinvention from arch-austerian to big spender has been forced by the German constitutional court’s ruling on 5 May, questioning the legality of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme, and thus the entirety of the EU’s legal regime.
“Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law – but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends,” said Merkel. “The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German Parliament does. That’s what we are seeing in the ECB case.”
While the ruling of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe represented “a conflict”, Merkel said, it did not fundamentally challenge the legal order of the EU: “That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen.”"

Angela Merkel voiced fears that people do not appreciate what it will mean to slump into the “deepest recession since the second world war”, as EU leaders clashed over a recovery fund for the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
During a video conference call among the 27 heads of state and government, the German chancellor gave her backing to the French president, Emmanuel Macron’s call for agreement before the summer holidays on a €750bn rescue package.
Merkel said Europe faced “very, very difficult times” and mused on whether the gravity of the situation was truly understood as she addressed her counterparts phoning in from around the EU, according to diplomatic sources. The value of the economies of some member states are expected to shrink by up to 10% in 2020.
“It was clear that we wouldn’t reach a result today but we will continue discussions in mid-July,” Merkel later told reporters. “Everyone said what they thought was positive and of course brought in points of criticism too. The bridges that we still have to build are big.”
Macron had also urged his fellow leaders to find common ground next month, citing the need to calm the markets before a difficult phase of talks on the future trade and security relationship with the UK. Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands want the recovery fund to offer them support in the event of the negotiation ending without a deal.
The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, conceded that “no one can say with certainty where these negotiations [with the UK] will be at the end of this year”.
During their first real talks about the pandemic rescue fund, the leaders provided starkly different views on the overall scale of the funds to be distributed, the balance of loans and grants and the criteria by which money is allocated.
Some EU leaders – including those representing the “frugal four” of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark – remain unconvinced by the need for condition-free grants.
One diplomat from one of the sceptical countries said: “If we as an EU are going to borrow money, we don’t want to say ‘yes’ first and only then work out what we spend it on, how we spend it and who gets what.
“Are you borrowing money to borrow or to invest? Then you first need to know what you are going to spend it on and how profitable it is. But the whole political discourse of some countries is exactly the other way around: give us money first and then everything will be fine.”
Charles Michel, the president of the European council, the body through which the heads of state and government are represented, told reporters at the end Friday’s discussions that he would organise a physical meeting of leaders in the middle of July in Brussels to start concrete negotiations on the EU’s long-term budget and the pandemic recovery plan.
“On some topics it remains very complex and very different,” Michel said. “We will work very hard to accelerate the negotiations in order to have an efficient and useful meeting in July.”
The commission has particularly upset some of the more hawkish leaders by suggesting that the allocation should in part be based on unemployment in the member states before the crisis.
Von der Leyen defended the EU executive’s proposal, insisting that the planned injection of funds, raised through common issuing of EU debt, needed to address the reasons why some countries suffered more badly than others.
She said: “The damaging effect was of course prominent in member states that were not resilient enough in the overall structure to absorb the shock of the crisis … This is very well represented in the unemployment rate over the last years.”

All across the continent, most Europeans now trust their leaders generally, and how they have handled the coronavirus pandemic in particular, a little less than when the crisis began – but nowhere has public confidence fallen as far and as fast as in the UK.
Even leaders seen as having managed Covid-19 the most successfully, such as Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel and Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen, have suffered slight dips in popular satisfaction as the weeks have worn on.
Others, such as the French president Emmanuel Macron, have seen more significant, potentially worrying declines, but have since recovered. Compared with Britain, no other European government in YouGov’s Covid-19 perception tracker has seen public trust plunge by 30 points.
As the coronavirus crisis gathered pace in Europe three months ago, the personal approval ratings of the continent’s leaders, including Boris Johnson, surged under the common effect in times of crisis familiar to political scientists as “rally round the flag”.
As much of continental Europe endured strict lockdowns from mid-March onwards, YouGov’s rolling perception poll – which monitors the percentage of people who think their government is handling the crisis “very” or “somewhat” well – showed parallel levels of public satisfaction.
In Denmark, the figure peaked in mid-April at 88%. In Germany it was 72%, in Britain 72% and in France – where voters are consistently more critical of their governments than the rest of the continent – at 54%. Since then, as governments began the tricky process of gradually easing restrictions, voters have become more sceptical. But not, generally, by much.
Germany, which alongside a relatively relaxed six-week shutdown instituted a track and trace system that was highly effective in halting its outbreak, has recorded just under 185,000 cases and fewer than 9,000 fatalities, corresponding to a death toll per million inhabitants of 104.
Macron remains vulnerable to a strong challenge in the 2022 presidential elections
With a doctorate in quantum chemistry, Merkel’s calm clarity has helped to maintain satisfaction with her government’s response at 70% this week, just two points down from its peak. Personal approval of the chancellor, in her fourth and final term, has surged to almost 80% and her centre-right CDU party has also fared well in the polls, up from 28% at the start of the crisis to 39%, according to Politico’s Poll of Polls.
Frederiksen has emerged equally strongly from the crisis in Denmark. The prime minister acted fast, closing the Scandinavian country’s borders as early as 13 March and following up a few days later by shutting all kindergartens, schools and universities and banning gatherings of more than 10 people.
One of the first EU countries to start easing its lockdown, Denmark’s per-million death toll is slightly lower than Germany’s, at just over 100. Public satisfaction with Frederiksen’s government has slipped just three points and remains at 85%, while support for her Social Democrats has surged from 27% to 35% – its highest share since 2006.
In France, one of the Europe’s harder-hit countries with a per-million death toll of 433, Macron and his government – which has coped, on balance, reasonably well, and better than many comparable countries – have been the target of heavy criticism over an early shortage of face masks and a long delay in beginning widespread testing.
But since public satisfaction in the government’s response slumped to 36% in the second half of March, it has climbed steadily back to 42% for a net fall of 14 points, while his personal approval rating stands at 44%, relatively high by French presidential standards.
Without a longstanding, grassroots power base, however, Macron remains vulnerable to a strong challenge in the 2022 presidential elections. According to French media, his entourage are worried not so much by the far-right Marine Le Pen but a populist outsider such as the comedian Jean-Marie Bigard or TV presenter Cyril Hanouna.
In Italy, the continental European country with the highest number of deaths in total and a per-million tally of 557, satisfaction with the government’s handling of the crisis has slipped 12 points from its mid-March peak, but remains at 66%.
Support for the coalition, headed by the former law professor Giuseppe Conte, however, appears not to have been much dented by the crisis: the centre-left Democratic party remains on 21%, and the anti-establishment M5S on 15%.
In Spain, which has reported continental Europe’s third highest death toll and a per-million tally of 580, appreciation for the way the Socialist-led government has responded to the coronavirus has actually risen since mid-March, from 42% to 46%.
Voter backing for the prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist party remains stable in the polls at 27% – although the conservative opposition People’s party, which has been fiercely critical of the coalition government throughout, has been making up ground.
Only in Britain, where the death toll of more than 50,000 equates to a per-million count of more than 600, and Johnson has struggled to contain the fallout from Dominic Cummings’ controversial road trip, has the verdict on the government’s Covid-19 effort collapsed so spectacularly, from 72% in mid-March to 41% this week.
Support for the Conservative party, which had risen continuously since last summer and peaked at 52% in late March, has also now fallen to 44%.

And in one bound she was transformed. For Angela Merkel, the days of being lampooned as the archetypal Swabian housewife keeping tight control over the purse strings are over. Now, courtesy of a €130bn (£116bn) stimulus package, she is the spend, spend, spend chancellor.
Make no mistake, much of the past criticism of Germany’s frugal approach to government spending and budget deficits was justified. Saving some money for a rainy day is one thing but running surpluses worth 8% of national output was unnecessary and harmful to the global economy.
Nobody can accuse Europe’s biggest economy of stinting on this occasion. The package was bigger than expected and, at about 4% of GDP, doubles the size of Germany’s tax and spending stimulus since the start of the crisis.
In recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.
Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.
How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.
This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.
Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.
Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.
In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.
Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.
However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”
The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.
In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.
Peter Beaumont, Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam
Germany showed the rest of Europe what was needed to limit the spread of the virus: a decentralised testing programme; a manufacturing sector capable of producing medical equipment quickly; and a political system that prizes results over grandstanding. Now it is showing other countries how to do the recovery.
It is not just a question of money, important though that is. The package is a well-crafted mixture of a short-term spending boost, targeted support for those parts of the economy that need it and measures that will help lay the foundations for long-term sustainable growth.
There is a time limited cut in VAT lasting from July until the end of the year, which should persuade German consumers to spend some of the euros they have accumulated during lockdown. There is recognition of the pressure on families, with a payment of €300 per child, extra incentives to buy electric cars, and grants worth €25bn for small businesses in those sectors, such as hospitality, that will take longest to recover from lockdown restrictions.
All that will ensure Germany will be one of the first countries to get output back to its pre-crisis levels. Yet, the package also included €50bn for investment programmes, with a focus on making the transition to a greener economy.
All this is a bit of a contrast to the UK experience. So far, Rishi Sunak has administered large amounts of expensive sticking plaster to the economy but not much more. As he contemplates options for a summer mini-budget, the chancellor could do worse than to study what the Germans have come up with. A lot worse, in fact.
After a little bit of pressure, the Bank of England has revealed the names of the big companies that have been taking advantage of its coronavirus corporate lending scheme and how much they are in for. An interesting list it is, too.
For those a little confused by the blizzard of government schemes designed to keep business going through the pandemic crisis, the Covid corporate financing facility (CCFF) allows a company to sell its short-term bonds to Threadneedle Street in exchange for cash.
Few would quibble with the basic principle behind the CCFF. The government stopped planes from flying, football clubs from playing and shops from opening so it was obliged to give the likes of British Airways, Tottenham Hotspur FC and John Lewis a helping hand. The alternative was to turn Britain into a tumbleweed economy.
So far, the Bank has lent £16bn to more than 50 businesses. To qualify, a company need not be UK-owned. It merely has to have sizeable revenues in this country and be a sizeable employer. That explains why the German chemicals company BASF came to be the biggest borrower from the Bank under the scheme, with £1bn outstanding, and that Nissan has borrowed £600m.
Clearly, it would be foolish to deny a company help because it is foreign-owned, since all the evidence is that German, French, Japanese and US run companies are more productive than indigenous businesses.
A much more serious criticism is that the money has been provided with no strings attached. BA has announced 12,000 job losses despite securing £300m from the scheme. EasyJet tapped the CCFF for £600m but said it will axe 4,500 jobs – 30% of its workforce. The government appears not to have received or even asked for any job guarantees from companies, nor to demand that a quid pro quo for state support should be a reduction in the airlines’ carbon footprint.
All crises represent an opportunity as well as a threat. The opportunity here was for the government to use its financial leverage to change corporate behaviour for the better. That opportunity has been blown."

Germany has unveiled a €130bn (£116.4bn) package of tax and spending measures designed to boost the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
Announcing measures to drag Europe’s largest economy out of recession as lockdown measures are removed, Angela Merkel’s government said it would use the package of sweeping temporary tax cuts and increase benefits to turbocharge its recovery.
Measures included a cut in VAT until the end of this year and substantial payments for every child in the country designed to help ordinary German families, alongside the launch of a €50bn fund to tackle global heating and finance new technologies. A state financial incentive to buy an electric car has been doubled to €6,000.
Against a backdrop of rising unemployment and with Germany already in a technical recession before Covid-19 struck, Merkel said a “bold response” was required to secure jobs and keep the economy running. Measures announced include:
A temporary VAT cut from 19% to 16%, from 1 July until 31 December
A €300 one-off payment for every child in the country
A €50bn fund to address climate change, innovation and digital technology›
A €25bn loan support programme for small firms that have seen their sales drop by more than 60% for June to August. This could be a particular boost for bars, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality businesses.
€10bn for municipalities struggling with lower tax receipts, with public spending on infrastructure and housing.
Up until now, countries around the world had largely announced emergency financial support to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak rather than jump-start a recovery. Germany’s package of measures comes on top of a €750bn rescue package agreed in March. It included loan guarantees and direct spending measures such as furlough wage subsidies.
Germany had typically taken a conservative approach to tax and spending policy in recent years, despite repeated calls to loosen the purse strings to boost the economy as growth faltered.
Merkel’s government came under pressure earlier this year to spend after overseeing a record €13.5bn budget surplus last year while the country’s economy slowed.
Berlin’s latest plans, however, come as more countries lift lockdown controls and attempt to reboot their economies as the world slides into its deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be drawing up plans for a summer financial statement to revitalise the UK economy, which is likely to focus on infrastructure spending and job creation schemes.
Three former British chancellors told Sunak on Wednesday to prepare for 1980s levels of unemployment across the country as the coronavirus crash causes widespread job losses.
Alistair Darling, Labour’s chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, said Sunak should also consider temporary VAT cuts similar to those used more than a decade ago during the financial crisis.
The former chancellors also suggested more funding for green growth, job support and retraining for the newly unemployed would also be vital for Britain’s recovery.

Most of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government’s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that the opposite is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.
Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU’s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.
On the other side of the same coin, there are growing fears in cabinet that maintaining close EU ties would lock the UK into the EU’s post-Covid-19 economic measures designed for its 27 member states, with little regard for the UK’s interests. This is nonsense, as the EU’s rescue package unveiled last Wednesday assumes no UK financial contribution. But it is a powerful argument on the Eurosceptic backbenches and has scared many in cabinet.
Another argument popular with backbench Brexiteers, but now more prominent among ministers, is the belief that coronavirus presents the government with an opportunity to “bury” the loss of growth from no trade deal under the cover of the much more dramatic drop in GDP caused by coronavirus.
The politics of this are very juicy for the Vote Leave team in the driving seat in government. Not least because it is only really a no deal that fully delivers on their substantive “divergence” agenda, while any version of a deal with the EU, no matter how distant, will ultimately tie the UK into EU rules and regulations in some way, an idea they hate and are loth to accept. No deal also facilitates a trade deal with the US, and the symbolism of “Global Britain” is key for ministers – far more important than the limited economic benefit a UK-US trade pact would bring.
Time is also running out. Despite three rounds of talks so far, no progress has been made and negotiators on both sides are downbeat about the likelihood of a breakthrough this week. Big gaps remain – in the UK over whether and how far to align to EU standards, the role of the European court of justice and the EU’s demands to fish in UK waters. But the government won’t extend the transition period. Boris Johnson believes he would struggle to sell to voters the extra £10bn in financial contributions and further spell of EU control of UK laws that this would bring.
A political intervention on both sides will therefore be needed to move beyond the current stage. There will l be an opportunity this month, when Johnson meets the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, virtually, around the time of a long-planned EU leaders’ session in June to review progress. But the EU is unlikely to change its mandate and absent progress, ministers plan to make a judgment in September so they can give business clarity about the trading arrangements from 1 January. They may switch to assuming and preparing for no deal then.
Finally, the survival of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s closest adviser, despite allegations he broke the lockdown rules, also enhances the prospect of no deal. One reason why Brexiteer ministers and aides rallied behind him is that he sees it as his personal mission to prevent Johnson extending the transition period in June, and delivering a version of Brexit that lets the UK “take back control”. It would be wrong to underestimate his impact on the outcome of these negotiations.
Of course, this could all be tactics and bluster. Johnson and his cheerleaders on the backbenches have convinced themselves that such brinkmanship worked during the withdrawal agreement talks, so it is no real surprise they intend to repeat the trick now. Especially as they believe, wrongly, that coronavirus will make the EU more desperate to conclude a deal and buckle at the last moment. But Downing Street is right that December is the real deadline.
Germany’s role will be key. I say this not as a naive Brit, believing that Angela Merkel will ride to Britain’s rescue, but as someone who has spent more than two decades studying and working on EU affairs. With Germany at the head of Europe’s rotating presidency, and Merkel in the final throes of her chancellorship, she will find it very hard to sign off on no deal. Of all of the EU’s member states, Germany has been the most focused on the longer-term, geopolitical risk of no deal, and the necessity for the UK and EU to maintain constructive ties.
But even Merkel can’t and won’t save the UK from itself, and will not agree to a deal at any price. If the net effect of Covid-19 is that ministers see more benefit than cost from no deal, with the dominant view in cabinet now opposed to extending the transitional period, then that will indeed be the outcome at the end of this year.

Donald Trump has been forced to cancel a planned face-to-face summit of G7 leaders in June and now wants to host an expanded meeting in September dedicated to countering China, to which Vladimir Putin would be invited.
Trump revealed on Saturday that he had cancelled the June meeting, which he had billed as a symbol of the US “transitioning back to greatness”, after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told him in a phone call that she saw the summit in Washington DC as a health risk. Hundreds of security staff, journalists and officials also attend the two-day summits.
Reports suggest the call between Merkel and Trump on Thursday was stormy, ranging over German plans for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, Hong Kong, and the potential health risks of a face-to-face summit.
Trump’s new plan, outlined to reporters on Saturday, is to host an expanded G7 meeting including Russia, Australia, South Korea and India, dedicated to building an alliance against China. The plan is likely to be controversial because Russia has been banned from western-led summits since Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the defence of human rights in Hong Kong.
Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform to set out his China strategy weeks before the US presidential election. The Republicans see a tough approach towards China as an election-winning formula, even though his likely Democrat challenger, Joe Biden, is also sharply critical of Beijing’s modern direction.
The G7 brings together the US, Japan, France, Germany, the UK, Canada and Italy.
Justifying the cancellation of the June meeting and his proposed new format, Trump said the group’s current makeup was “very outdated” and does not properly represent “what’s going on in the world”. He said he had not set a precise date for the new meeting, but suggested it might be around the time of the annual UN general assembly in New York, which is normally held in September, but there is no guarantee it will go ahead this year. The proposed “G11” meeting might also be held after the presidential election, he said.
Trump caught many capitals and White House officials by surprise on 20 May, when he tweeted: “Now that our Country is ‘Transitioning back to Greatness,’ I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David. The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all – normalization!”
It contradicted the US government’s previous announcement that the G7 meeting would be a teleconference as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The White House, however, confirmed within days that the meeting would be held on 25 and 26 June. It had originally been scheduled for 10 to 12 June at Camp David.
The Japanese foreign ministry had been reluctant for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to travel to Washington, in part because of the so-called Dominic Cummings effect.
Had Abe attended the summit, he would have been required either to quarantine himself for two weeks or take a Covid-19 test on his return. Officials told Japanese media they did not want Abe to be seen to be getting privileged treatment, and cited the backlash the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has faced for clearing his senior adviser of breaking UK quarantine rules.
Macron was also reported to be ambivalent about a face-to-face meeting in June, but Merkel’s spokesman broke the news that she could not guarantee her personal attendance.
European leaders are deeply critical of China’s intervention in Hong Kong, but the plan Trump set out to confront Beijing in a 10-minute address on Friday left many questions unanswered about the extent to which he is prepared to disengage the US economy from China or impose sanctions.
The EU has not yet supported sanctions, but a meeting of foreign ministers on Friday agreed that the language of a paper on China completed in early 2019 needed toughening.
The EU is also opposed to Trump’s decision to terminate Washington’s membership of the World Health Organization, privately saying the US president had not even formulated a coherent reform agenda for the UN body, let alone given the WHO time to respond to any US proposal.
The UK is hosting a virtual coronavirus vaccine summit on 4 June intended to establish a global alliance and raise funds for research, and will hope the US decision to withdraw from the WHO does not dominate the event.
… exposing further allegations of sexual harassment by Donald Trump. An American model became the 26th woman to accuse the US president of indecent behaviour. With an election imminent that will have repercussions around the world, stories like this matter. That’s why we invest heavily in journalism that reveals the truth.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will not attend a face-to-face meeting in the US with the leaders of the world’s major economies if Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said.
After cancelling the G7 summit, originally scheduled for 10 to 12 June at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was considering rescheduling an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic.
Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency on Saturday she had now made a decision.
“As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things changed."

When France and Germany announced a plan to raise €500bn (£448bn) on financial markets to fund a European coronavirus recovery plan, leaders sought to underscore the magnitude of the moment.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hailed “a real change of philosophy”, with the plan for the European commission to borrow money on behalf of the entire EU and issue grants to the most stricken industries and regions. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, declared: “The nation state has no future standing alone,” and the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, evoked the legacy of the US founding father Alexander Hamilton, who helped to transform the US into a true political unit with his scheme for the national government to take on debts accrued by individual states.
The head of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will on Wednesday seek to turn what was billed as a revolution and long-overdue constitutional moment for the EU into a detailed plan that commands the support of 25 other member states. Her paper is expected to fall into two parts: a revamped EU budget for 2021-27 that fills the €10bn-a-year Brexit hole, as well as a recovery plan to pull Europe’s economies out of what is forecast to be the worst collapse since the 1930s Great Depression. Spending will be heavily tilted to the European green deal, the pre-coronavirus plan to tackle the climate emergency, as well as boosting digital technology and research.
Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania between 2009 and 2019, said the Merkel-Macron plan was an “unavoidable step” for the EU given the scale of the economic shock. “We are going closer to fiscal union and that means deeper European integration,” she told the Guardian.
While Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, isn’t wholly convinced by comparisons with Hamilton – “I have a feeling that some people are basing their view a little bit too much on the play and not on the reality” – he described the Franco-German plan as “a very significant initiative” and “symbolically very important to portray solidarity”.
The joint statement by Merkel and Macron came as a surprise in Germany even to the chancellor’s party colleagues, many of whom had eyed Von der Leyen’s initial proposal for a corona recovery fund with suspicion.
But Merkel has had three domestic factors playing in her favour: her government’s handling of the pandemic has led to popularity ratings for her and her government rising to historic highs, while the party most vocally opposed to any form of pan-European burden-sharing, the far-right AfD, has been riven by infighting.
Finally, the chances of resistance to the Franco-German proposal from within her own CDU party have been considerably reduced by delegates not being able to meet in person. CDU meetings were held online during the lockdown, minimising room for plotting in dark corners.
Not all Merkel watchers believe that the recovery fund amounts to a policy U-turn, and within her party Merkel’s allies have been quick to emphasise to fiscal conservatives that the recovery fund would retain a characteristically CDU signature, with bonds that are time-limited and tied to specific projects.
Jana Puglierin, who heads the Berlin offices of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if there was a moment that would have changed Merkel’s mind about accepting more burden-sharing, it would have been 5 May, when Germany’s constitutional court in Karlsruhe questioned the legality of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme.
“The German government has form when it comes to tolerating policies it rhetorically opposes,” said Puglierin. “The Karlsruhe ruling made something impossible for Germany that it had long tolerated […] There was a sudden pressure to come up with an alternative.”
Germany’s conversion to joint European debt means the EU’s four largest nations are now united on a core economic principle. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, however, facing a steep 9.5% drop in output this year, has complained that the amount falls short of what is needed to keep the European economy afloat. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who has previously called for a €1.5tn recovery plan, described it cautiously as “a positive step in the right direction”.
Luis Garicano, an economics professor who represents the Spanish centrist Ciudadanos party in the European parliament, says <U+FEFF>he worries that the Merkel-Macron plan will become “hopelessly damaged” in the long hours of negotiations between EU leaders. “That is the risk as it goes through all the negotiations, that this clear recognisable plan becomes this messy Christmas tree construction.”
Merkel and Macron had barely left their respective podiums before a warning shot was fired by the EU’s self-styled “frugal four” nations, via Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden revealed their own plan at the weekend, calling for a recovery fund based on loans “not leading to any mutualisation of debt”.
Meanwhile, there are worries among beneficiaries of EU funds that money will be redirected south rather than east. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, told national media it would be “unfair to be penalised for being successful”, referring to the low number of coronavirus cases in his country.
These opening gambits raise the prospect of another euro stalemate, yet Grybauskaite, a veteran of EU crisis summits, is confident there will be a compromise. She said there had been an important change since February, when leaders had failed to agree a seven-year budget. “Germany agreed to pay a large amount of money to save the European economy. That’s as simple as it is … How can you block it?”
Stubb, who served as his country’s finance minister during many bailout meetings, also expects a compromise that neither fully satisfies north, south or east, nor matches the original Franco-German proposal. For him, it’s a classic European story, following the arc of crisis, chaos and ending in “suboptimal solutions” – another messy end for a union that is neither the utopia of its admirers nor the dystopia of critics.
“This will be a good solution but of course it will be suboptimal because by definition that is what European decisions are.”"

In 1790, following the American war of independence, Alexander Hamilton proposed that federal government should take on the huge debts incurred during the struggle by individual states. It had long been Hamilton’s view that this move would be a key moment in the forging of a true United States of America. “A national debt,” he had written, “if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing. It will be a powerful cement of our union.”
Until now, this kind of thinking has never gained a foothold in the European Union. Despite periodic calls for deeper fiscal union, richer EU states have balked at the notion of pooling debt with weaker neighbours. After the crash of 2008, when Greece hovered on the edge of bankruptcy and a sovereign debt crisis threatened to engulf Italy, the EU went no further than the provision of emergency loans and cheap credit. The bailout money came with painful strings attached, as countries were obliged to launch deeply resented austerity programmes in order to manage their growing debt mountain. The alternative – writing off debts in Hamiltonian fashion – was dismissed out of hand by Germany’s finance minister at the time, Wolfgang Schäuble.
That was then. On Wednesday, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are expected to present plans for a €500bn (£448bn) EU recovery fund, which would distribute non-refundable grants to the countries that have suffered most during the coronavirus pandemic. Crucially, the money would be borrowed by the European commission on behalf of all member states, and sit within the EU budget to be agreed for 2021-27. Germany would be liable for about €135bn (£120bn). This could be a watershed moment. Since the adoption of the euro, there has been fierce argument over whether a common currency should entail at least some degree of common debt. The countries of the prosperous north, led by Germany, have resisted such talk. Governments have been wary of seeing their borrowing costs rise and conscious that such a move would be domestically unpopular. But Covid-19 is challenging old taboos.
Deprived of tourism revenue and facing the sharpest economic downturn in modern times, southern Europe fears a regional meltdown. Loan packages already agreed via the European Stability Mechanism, while welcome, will contribute to unprecedented levels of sovereign debt. In these dire circumstances, both Mr Macron and Ms Merkel have recognised that unless the burden of reconstruction is seen to be genuinely shared, there will be existential implications for the future of the EU.
Last week, Ms Merkel said the devastation wrought by the pandemic was of a magnitude such that it could “endanger the European Union’s cohesion”. Mr Macron has suggested the “European idea” itself will be in danger, unless there is a step-change in solidarity between the stronger and weaker eurozone states. They are both right.
The negotiations that begin on Wednesday will not be easy. At the weekend, the first signs of organised opposition to the Franco-German proposals emerged, led by the so-called “frugal four” of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. Eastern European countries, which have had far lower infection and death rates during the pandemic, have also balked at the idea of a jointly financed recovery fund. It is vital that the substance of the Merkel-Macron plan survives intact. Hamilton was right in thinking that debt assumption by Washington would consolidate the status of the emerging United States. The EU needs to act in the same spirit in these similarly dramatic times."

Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have proposed that the EU borrows on the financial markets in order to disperse some €500bn (£448bn) through grants to European economies hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
Under the Franco-German proposal the member states receiving the funds would not need to repay the cash. Liability for the debt would instead be added to the EU budget, to which member states contributions vary according to the size and prosperity of their economies.
Should the proposal receive the endorsement of the 25 other member states, it would amount to a significant move towards a level of burden-sharing and fiscal transfers firmly opposed during past crises. The European commission, the EU’s executive arm, would borrow the money under the EU’s name.
Speaking during a virtual press conference with France’s president, Merkel said: “We are convinced that it is not only fair but also necessary to now make available the funds ... that we will then gradually repay through several future European budgets.
“When Germany and France take the initiative, then this encourages the opinion-making process in the EU. We will have to act European in order to get well out of this crisis.”
Macron, who has described the current crisis as a “moment of truth” for the EU, said the bloc had failed to show sufficient solidarity at the start of the pandemic, emphasising that the new cash would be given out in grants rather than loans.
He said: “What is sure is that these €500bn will not be repaid by the beneficiaries … We are proposing to do real transfers [of money] ... that’s a major step.”
Austria’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz nevertheless made clear that the Franco-German initiative would face resistance from some northern EU member states.
He tweeted: “Just had a good exchange with the Prime Ministers of Denmark, Netherlands & Sweden on the expected proposal by the EU Commission on the recovery fund and the updated [EU long term budget].
“Our position remains unchanged. We are ready to help most affected countries with loans. We expect the updated [budget] to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling.”
While the proposal is a significant move towards sharing debt, a move that has been firmly resisted in the past by the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Finland, among others, the recovery fund would have a strict shelf-life and “volume”, according to a paper published by Berlin.
The Dutch government in particular has been concerned at any move that could institutionalise debt-sharing and unconditional grants, claiming that there is a moral hazard in bailing out member states that have failed to prepare for economic difficulties.
Merkel stressed during the press conference that the recovery fund should be seen as a “one-off effort” and that “because of the unusual nature of the crisis, we are choosing an unusual path”.
There is growing anxiety that the different speeds at which EU countries recover from the pandemic, and the lockdowns it has enforced, could prove to be an existential threat to the bloc. Earlier this month the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, conceded that companies in rich countries including Germany had been given an unfair advantage by the relaxation of the EU’s state aid rules.
The commission’s recent economic forecasts suggest that Germany will also have a far less dramatic contraction of its economy than most other member states. In contrast, Greece’s gross domestic product is forecast to shrink the most, by 9.7%, owing to the closure of its tourist industry. GDP in Italy and Spain is expected to contract by 9.5% and 9.4% respectively.
Von der Leyen, who is expected to unveil the commission’s own plan next week, welcomed the Franco-German announcement, in a coordinated statement.
She said: “It acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces, and rightly puts the emphasis on the need to work on a solution with the European budget at its core.
“This goes in the direction of the proposal the commission is working on, which will also take into account the views of all member states and the European parliament.”
The comments were echoed by Charles Michel, the president of the European council, which comprises the heads of government and state of EU member countries.
“This is a step in the right direction,” the former prime minister of Belgium said. “In order to reach an agreement, all 27 EU member states will be involved. I call all 27 member states to work in a spirit of compromise as soon as the [European commission] has tabled a proposal. Relaunching and transforming our economies impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic is key.”
Macron conceded that a French-German deal alone “doesn’t mean an agreement from the 27”. A European council of the 27 heads of state and government is expected to debate the proposal next month."

Angela Merkel has said Russian hacking attacks on the Bundestag in which her emails were seized harmed efforts to build a trusting relationship with Moscow.
Merkel told the German parliament on Wednesday that she had been pained to learn of the 2015 hack and the perpetrator.
The news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that an investigation by German intelligence authorities found that agents in Russia’s GRU military intelligence service carried out the attack. Moscow has denied all allegations that it has hacked foreign governments.
Merkel was responding to a question from Tabea Rößner, an MP with the opposition Green party, about her views on the outcome of the investigation. Merkel said she was pleased that investigators had found out who was responsible for the attack and were seeking to make arrests.
“I take it very seriously,” Merkel said. “I may very honestly say it pains me. On the one hand I make an effort on a daily basis to have a better relationship with Russia. But when you see on the other hand that there is hard evidence that Russian powers are behaving in that way, then of course it’s an area of tension … that remains inside me. That is unpleasant.”
Asked by Manuel Höferlin, of the pro-business Free Democrats, to clarify her use of the word unpleasant, which he said was inadequate, she answered: “Unpleasant is just one part of it, but I also find it outrageous as well. Of course it damages any sort of trusting collaboration.”
She said other parliamentary colleagues had also been affected by having their emails hacked in the attack, and would also find it outrageous.
She said what she called Russia’s hybrid warfare was “a strategy … which we need to keep an eye on and which we cannot suppress.”
It has always been suspected that the hack five years ago, which paralysed Germany’s parliament for several days, was used to acquire sensitive data that was later used in an attempt to destabilise the political system in the run-up to federal elections of 2017.
IT experts from the FBI and German intelligence authorities have gathered evidence showing that the attack was carried out by the hacker collective APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, working for the GRU. The same group is believed to have been behind the hack attack on the Democratic party in the run-up to the US presidential elections in 2016.
Specific focus for the attack is now on Dimitri Badin, an agent for the GRU who is believed to have led the spying operation. Germany’s general prosecutor has put out a warrant for his arrest.
Merkel said Germany would take the appropriate measures just as it had when sanctions were introduced against Russian diplomats following the murder last summer in Berlin’s Tiergarten park of a former Chechen insurgent, which Germany believes was a contract killing carried out on behalf of the Russian state.

Boris Johnson has been heavily criticised for failing to show Britain a clear route out of lockdown. Easing a nation out of two months of confinement is a complicated business, and some degree of confusion is almost inevitable. Here, Guardian correspondents look at how other European leaders have managed the process.
Spain’s lockdown exit strategy – known formally as the Plan for the Transition Towards the New Normality – was outlined by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, during a televised press conference on the evening of 28 April. Sánchez said the country’s four-phase de-escalation initiative would be “gradual and asymmetric”, adding that the first stage – dubbed phase 0 – would come into effect on 4 May.
The prime minister stressed that decisions on moving from one phase to the next would be made on a province-by-province basis, and that some of the worst-affected areas of the country would have to wait longer to move back towards normality. There was some confusion over whether people in areas that had entered phase 1 would be allowed to travel to second homes if they were in the same province. After some mixed messages, the government confirmed that would be possible.
Germany’s gradual lockdown easing announcements have generally been made via press conferences held by the individual leaders of the 16 states, each of which have taken different paths out of lockdown. That in itself has caused confusion: fitness centres are open in North Rhine-Westphalia but not in Berlin; church services were allowed in Bavaria before they were allowed elsewhere. Where and with whom you can have a picnic varies from state to state, as does the number of people who are now allowed to meet together. In general, announcements have been made days or in some cases weeks before they are due to come into force, to give restaurants, schools and businesses time to prepare.
The chancellor, Angela Merkel, has accused some states of moving too fast and ensured all lockdown relaxation agreements include a measure obliging local authorities to reimpose restrictions if coronavirus infections in any municipality exceed 50 per 100,000 inhabitants.
There was some disappointment and frustration when the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, made his speech on the so-called phase 2 of the coronavirus emergency, but little confusion. He spoke to the nation on 26 April, a week before Italy began easing lockdown rules. The plan for the next few weeks was clearly laid out: manufacturing and construction would resume from 4 May, while bars and restaurants could begin providing a takeout service. Museums, libraries and retailers would reopen on 18 May; bars, restaurants and hairdressers from 1 June, and schools from September. People could walk or exercise in a park, but not travel between regions.
The main point of confusion was when Conte said citizens could visit relatives. He later clarified that this would include partners. Visiting friends, however, is still banned. People are still required to carry a self-declaration form when venturing out. The overall takeaway to “stay home” as much as possible. There was some confusion due to Italy’s regions adapting some regulations: Veneto and Calabria allowed bars and restaurants with outdoor service to open earlier.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, unveiled the broad outlines of its lockdown exit in a TV address on 15 April, with the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, presenting the details to parliament on 28 April in an hour-long speech also broadcast live.
Restrictions would be lifted region by region, but in principle, schools would begin a staggered return and most businesses (except cafes, bars, restaurants, cinemas and theatres) could reopen from 11 May. Employees would be encouraged to continue working from home if possible and public transport would resume, with masks compulsory and every other seat empty. Travel outside a 100km (60-mile) radius from home would be permitted only for professional or urgent family reasons, and people could start socialising again in groups of no more than 10. Individual sports would be permitted but beaches and some parks will remain closed at least until 1 June, as would larger museums.
Confusion remained over self-isolation rules for people who tested positive, quarantine for travellers to France, what exactly constituted an essential journey and the circumstances masks in which masks would be mandatory, which Philippe addressed in a second presentation on 7 May.
Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, first announced on 30 March that the country could begin a “gradual, quiet and controlled opening” after Easter. She told a press conference on 6 April that schools for children up to 11 would reopen the following week; some parents objected, saying they did not want their children to be “guinea-pigs”.
On 6 May, Frederiksen announced phase 2 of the country’s exit from lockdown, with “the entire retail sector, including large shopping centres” to reopen as early as 11 May and senior schools and restaurants from 18 May. Last week she said cinemas, museums and zoos could reopen from 8 June, and eased a limit on group gatherings from a maximum of 10 to 30 or 50, depending on the event.
Frederiksen, who has won praise for her straight-talking speeches and clear instructions, also warned that it was expected that reopenings would “lead to a rise in infections and hospital admissions”, and that restrictions would be reimposed if the rise was significant.

Seventy-five years ago crowds massed in the streets of Europe, singing and dancing as their leaders announced the end of six years of bloody war. On Friday, the streets were empty, and leaders stood alone in silence at places of commemoration, as a continent marked the heroics of the war generation in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, took part in a scaled-down version of the traditional commemorations on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, alongside his two most recent predecessors, François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy.
The event was observed by about 20 spectators, including the presidents of the national assembly and senate, the minister of the armed forces, Florence Parly, and Paris’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo.
During the 30-minute ceremony, Macron lay a wreath and relit the flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A small military choir sang the national anthem, the Marseillaise.
Earlier, the French president visited and laid a wreath at the foot of a statue of Gen Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French forces during France’s occupation and liberation.
Macron tweeted: “May 8, 1945, Victory. The flame of the Unknown Soldier is still burning for the heroes who brought us peace. 75 years later, women and men are fighting for this peace to live. For them, raise our colours high.”
At a distance of 1.5 metres, Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the country’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, came together to mark a “lonely” commemoration.
Steinmeier spoke of his sadness that representatives of the allies and thousands of young people were unable to join the two German leaders to lay a wreath at the Neue Wache in Berlin, the country’s main memorial to the victims of the war and the Nazi dictatorship.
“Perhaps this being alone will take us back to May 8, 1945, because at that time the Germans were actually alone … defeated militarily, politically and economically … morally shattered. We had made ourselves the enemy of the whole world,” Steinmeier said.
The president said that while 8 May is known today in Germany as Liberation Day, three-quarters of a century ago “it was far from being that in the minds and hearts of most Germans”.
Steinmeier thanked “all those in the world who gave this country the chance to start again”. He warned against the “the temptation of a new nationalism”.
“For us Germans, ‘never again’ means ‘never again alone’,” he said. “We want more, not less, cooperation in the world – also in the fight against the pandemic.”
Earlier, the Bundestag leader of the far-right AfD party, Alexander Gauland, criticised the city of Berlin for making 8 May a one-off public holiday on what he described as a “day of complete defeat” for Germany.
Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said in response that Gauland’s view was typical of “neo-Nazis”.
At a wreath-laying commemoration at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, wearing a black mask, expressed the mixed emotions of many his compatriots, given the decades of Soviet repression that followed the defeat of the Nazis. VE Day is known as National Victory Day in Poland.
“This is an anniversary for us every year in what is a bittersweet sense,” Duda said. “Sweet because world war two ended, this bloody slaughter in the history of the 20th century and in the history of humanity ended, in which so many people lost their lives - almost 6 million of our citizens, including over 3 million Polish citizens of Jewish nationality.”
In the Czech Republic, where a lockdown has been partially lifted, politicians arrived at 10-minute intervals to lay wreaths on Prague’s Vitkov Hill, to minimise contact.
Vladimir Putin sent a message to Boris Johnson ahead of Russia’s national commemoration on 9 May.
Putin expressed confidence that the memory of the two nations’ “brotherhood-in-arms” would lead to constructive dialogue and cooperation between Russia and the UK.
He wrote: “The Great Victory was a pivotal event of the 20th century with enduring significance for the fate of all humankind. It was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition. That invaluable experience is no less needed today.”
Seven veterans, including participants in the D-day landings and 97-year-old Gregory Melikian, who was tasked in the early hours of 7 May 1945 with sending the coded message announcing Germany’s unconditional surrender, defied the dangers posed by the pandemic to join Donald Trump at a wreath-laying ceremony on Friday.
Long-held plans to fly the men to a major commemoration in Russia had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. The men, the youngest of whom is 96, were described as “choosing nation over self” by agreeing to join the US president at the World War II Memorial in Washington close to Capitol Hill. They then joined Trump as guests of honour at the White House.
Melikian, from Phoenix, Arizona, told the Guardian: “My heroes are the guys that hit the beaches in 6,400 ships. So many never came back and are buried underneath white tombstones.”
Timothy Davis, director of the Greatest Generations Foundation, a charity that helps veterans return to the countries where they fought, said the men had sought to commemorate the day in Washington.
“Of course, we presented to them the risk we are facing,” Davis said. “They said, ‘It doesn’t matter, Tim’.”"

Angela Merkel has introduced some new ground rules for relaxing physical-distancing restrictions in an attempt to reassert her authority over Germany’s 16 federal states, some of whom have announced unilateral re-opening plans.
In recent days the German chancellor has struggled to preserve a fragile compromise over the introduction of nationwide lockdown measures bartered with federal states in mid-March.
But during a lengthy video conference on Wednesday afternoon, she managed to rein in some of the regional tearaways by introducing a new “emergency mechanism” that can be triggered to contain local Covid-19 outbreaks.
As latest official figures confirmed that the spread of the virus was slowing in Germany, Merkel and state premiers said people would be allowed to meet and move in public not just with members of their household but also with “persons belonging to one other household”.
Elderly people in risk groups still required “special attention”, Merkel said at a press conference, without categorically ruling out family reunions in smaller groups. The requirement to keep a 1.5m safety distance would remain in place.
However, the German leader said relaxing physical distancing rules would only be possible if the country adhered to a new “emergency mechanism”, whereby hospitals, care homes or entire municipalities would be put under lockdown if they accumulatively registered more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days.
If the consensus over lockdown measures appeared to have slipped from Merkel’s grasp in recent days, the new emergency mechanism represents a small victory for the chancellor following opposition from the northern city states of Hamburg and Bremen.
“We have to be careful that this thing doesn’t slip from our grasp,” Merkel said. She said Germany was following a “very open and brave path” by having avoided a stricter lockdown of the kind applied in France, Italy or Spain.
Further steps in the lockdown exit strategy involve the reopening of shops including department stores and shopping malls, as well as a phased reopening of restaurants and bars with new hygiene requirements by 22 May.
The German football league’s first and second division will restart “in the second half of May”, with the German football association to rule on Thursday whether games will kick off on the weekend of 15 or 22 May.
The decision on whether to reopen restaurants, hotels, cinemas, theatres and concert halls – and if so, when, and under what restrictions – has been delegated to the 16 federal governments.
Nurseries will expand emergency care to beyond families where parents qualify as “essential workers”. Elderly people in care homes will be able to select a “reference person” that is allowed to pay them visits.
The latest official figures in Germany appear to show that the first steps to relax physical-distancing restrictions have not had the dramatic impact on infection rates some had originally feared.
The number of new infections has in recent days repeatedly stayed below 1,000 and the virus’s reproduction number has stayed below one. Merkel spoke of a “very, very good development”."

But few with female leaders have done badly
On 1 April, the prime minister of Sint Maarten addressed her nation’s 41,500 people. Coronavirus cases were rising, and Silveria Jacobs knew the small island country, which welcomes 500,000 tourists a year, was at great risk: it had two ICU beds.
Jacobs did not want to impose a strict lockdown, but she did want physical distancing observed. So she spelled it out: “Simply. Stop. Moving,” she said. “If you don’t have the bread you like in your house, eat crackers. Eat cereal. Eat oats. Eat … sardines.”
The 51-year-old Caribbean premier may not have the global profile of Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern, but her blunt message exemplified firm action, effective communication – and showed another female leader getting the job done.
From Germany to New Zealand and Denmark to Taiwan, women have managed the coronavirus crisis with aplomb. Plenty of countries with male leaders – Vietnam, the Czech Republic, Greece, Australia – have also done well. But few with female leaders have done badly.
Ardern, 39, New Zealand’s premier, has held Kiwis’ hands through the lockdown, delivering empathetic “stay home, save lives” video messages from her couch and communicating daily through non-combative press conferences or intimate Facebook Live videos, her favourite medium.
Her insistence on saving lives and her kindness-first approach – urging New Zealanders to look after their neighbours, take care of the vulnerable, and make sacrifices for the greater good – has won her many fans, while her emphasis on shared responsibility has united the country.
Choosing to “go hard and go early”, Ardern imposed a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering the country on 14 March and implemented a strict lockdown two weeks later, when fewer than 150 people had been infected and none had died. New Zealand has recorded just 18 deaths; public trust in Ardern’s government is greater than 80%.
In Germany, Angela Merkel has been hailed for direct but uncharacteristically personal public interventions, warning that up to 70% of people would contract the virus – the country’s “greatest challenge” since 1945 – and lamenting every death as that of “a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner …”
Thanks to extensive testing from the outset, plenty of intensive care beds, and the chancellor’s periodic forthright reminders that Covid-19 was “serious – so take it seriously”, Germany has so far recorded fewer than 5,000 deaths, a far lower figure than most EU countries.
With a doctorate in quantum chemistry, Merkel’s clear, calm expositions – a clip of her explaining the scientific basis behind the government’s lockdown exit strategy was shared thousands of times online – have also helped propel public approval of the fourth-term chancellor’s handling of the crisis above 70%.
In nearby Denmark, meanwhile, the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, acted equally firmly, closing the Scandinavian country’s borders as early as 13 March, and following up a few days later by shutting all kindergartens, schools and universities and banning gatherings of more than 10 people.
That decisiveness appears to have spared Denmark the worst of the pandemic, with fewer than 8,000 confirmed cases and 370 deaths. Frederiksen’s no-punches-pulled speeches and clear instructions to the nation have been widely praised.
She even managed to show a sense of fun, posting a clip on Facebook of herself doing the dishes while singing along to the 1980s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during the nation’s weekly TV lockdown singalong. The Scandinavian country’s youngest-ever prime minister, whose approval ratings have doubled to more than 80%, has now begun easing its lockdown.
Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen responded equally fast, activating the country’s central epidemic command centre in early January and introducing travel restrictions and quarantine measures. Mass public hygiene measures were rolled out, including disinfecting public areas and buildings.
In all, Taiwan adopted 124 control and contain measures in weeks, making a full lockdown unnecessary. It has reported just six deaths, and is now dispatching millions of face masks to the worst-struck parts of the US and Europe. Tsai’s warm, authoritative style has won her plaudits, even from political opponents.
Norway, with 7,200 cases and 182 deaths, this week began relaxing its restrictions by reopening kindergartens. The prime minister, Erna Solberg, told CNN she had made a point of “letting scientists make the big medical decisions”, adding that she thought her country’s early lockdown and thorough testing programme had been key.
Following an example set earlier by Frederiksen, Solberg also took the unusual step of directly addressing the country’s children, telling them in two press conferences – from which adult journalists were banned – that it was “permitted to be a little bit scared” and that she, too, missed being able to hug her friends.
Meanwhile, Iceland, under the prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s, leadership, has offered free testing to all citizens, not only those with symptoms, and has recorded 1,800 cases and 10 deaths. Some 12% of the population has taken up the offer, and an exhaustive tracing system has meant the country has not had to close schools.
Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin – who last year became the world’s youngest head of government – also moved decisively to impose a strict lockdown, including a ban on all non-essential travel in and out of the Helsinki region. This has helped her country contain the spread of the virus to just 4,000 cases and 140 deaths, a per-million toll 10 times lower than that of neighbouring Sweden.
Not all the women who have excelled in the corona crisis are national leaders. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the unflappable head of South Korea’s centre for disease control, has become a national icon after overseeing a “test, trace, contain” strategy that has made the country the world’s coronavirus role-model, with daily infections in single digits and a death toll of less than 250.
Jeong, a former rural doctor dubbed “the world’s best virus hunter”,  has delivered no-nonsense daily press conferences, including demonstrating the ideal way to cough. While these have won praise, her work ethic – she has left an emergency operations bunker only for quick visits to a food truck – has prompted concern for her health.
Whatever conclusions we may draw from these leaders’ performances during the pandemic, experts caution that while women are “disproportionately represented to a rather startling degree” among countries managing the crisis well, dividing men and women heads of state and government into homogenous categories is not necessarily useful.
Complicating factors may be at play. Kathleen Gerson, a professor of sociology at New York University, notes, for example, that women leaders are more likely to be elected in “a political culture in which there’s a relative support and trust in the government – and that doesn’t make stark distinctions between women and men. So you’ve already got a head start”.
In addition, it may be harder for men to escape “the way they are expected to behave” as leaders, Gerson told The Hill website. And since the very best leaders are both strong and decisive and capable of displaying feeling, women could, perhaps, “lead the way in showing that these are not competing and conflicting attributes, but complementary – and necessary for good leadership”, she said.

That may be changing – not before time
Almost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in the frontline of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make common cause against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continent’s embattled poorer economies.
The good news, relatively speaking, is that this divide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a €540bn rescue package. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozone’s bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EU’s southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EU’s south and north.
Instead, France and the southern member states want the EU to make financial transfers to its worst-affected members. Some rich states, notably Germany, balk at this. All of them, though, want to avoid a prolongation of the EU’s damaging divisions of March and early April. As a result, the EU27 decided on Thursday that they would pass the parcel to Ursula von der Leyen and the European commission, who have been tasked with creating a recovery fund alongside the EU’s next seven-year budget, which is required by the start of 2021.
No figures have yet been agreed, but the recovery fund device could prove a smart way of allowing the EU and its richer member states to stand by the poorer ones. In Thursday’s virtual summit, Angela Merkel said that Germany, already the EU budget’s largest net contributor, would make a significantly higher contribution “in the spirit of solidarity”. Ms von der Leyen said afterwards that the EU would be trying to create a funding mechanism that allowed for a balance of grants and loans.
This will be anything but easy. Familiar disputes about the size of the EU budget have not disappeared. Indeed, the UK’s departure had made them trickier. Now, in time-honoured fashion, the EU has also kicked the can down the road over the recovery fund. But it cannot do that for long. Ms von der Leyen has only weeks to come up with a package. The package is likely to be enormous. But the economic damage caused by the pandemic means this issue is urgent and could still pose existential questions, as Emmanuel Macron said this week, for the EU itself.
This is a huge moment for the EU. But it has direct implications for Britain too. If the Brexit transition was to be extended into 2021, the UK would have to extend its budget contribution too. It is hard to see the current British government contributing to the EU recovery fund as well. Yet there are no easy choices for any government in the wake of the pandemic shutdown. The EU may be divided over the economic response. But if the choice for Britain lies between cooperation with a divided EU and cooperation with a United States led by a delinquent president who advocates ingesting disinfectant, it would be a no-brainer."

Global leaders have pledged to accelerate cooperation on a coronavirus vaccine and to share research, treatment and medicines across the globe. But the United States did not take part in the World Health Organization initiative, in a sign of Donald Trump’s increasing isolation on the global stage.
The cooperation pledge, made at a virtual meeting, was designed to show that wealthy countries will not keep the results of research from developing countries.
The meeting also represented a symbolic endorsement of the United Nations body in the face of Trump’s decision to suspend US payments and condemn its leaders as subordinates of the Chinese Communist party. China and the US have accused each other of bullying and disinformation over the coronavirus outbreak, damaging efforts to secure cooperation at the G20, the natural international institution to handle global health outside the UN.
Instead an ad hoc grouping of 20 world leaders and global health figures were on the call, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the American philanthropist Bill Gates. Britain will co-chair a joint coronavirus global response summit on 4 May aimed at raising funds for vaccine research, treatments and tests.
Macron told the meeting: “We will continue now to mobilise all G7 and G20 countries so they get behind this initiative. And I hope we will be able to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the US, because this is about saying the fight against Covid-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle.”
The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “We are facing a common threat that we can only defeat with a common approach. Experience has told us that even when tools are available they have not been equally available to all. We cannot allow that to happen.”
More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, according to Seth Berkley, the chief executive of the Gavi vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.
Berkley said it was critical that there was not a repeat of the experience in 2009, when the H1N1 vaccine did not reach developing countries until very late.
The US mission in Geneva confirmed there would be no official US participation, but said it looked forward to the outcome of the WHO meeting.
Five pledges were agreed on the call:
Provide access to new treatments, technologies and vaccines across the world.
Commit to an unprecedented level of international partnership on research and coordinate efforts to tackle the pandemic and reduce infections.
Reach collective decisions on responding to the pandemic, recognising that the virus’s spread in one country can affect all countries.
Learn from experience and adapt the global response.
Be accountable, to the most vulnerable communities and the whole world.
The heavily multilateral tone of the pledges contrasts with many countries’ immediate reaction to the outbreak, when countries banned the export of their medical equipment, closed borders and even tried to steal equipment from one another. The degree of cooperation over the vaccine research has also been patchy at best.
The meeting also agreed to appoint two new special envoys to lead global cooperation on vaccine research and to help ensure equal access to any successful vaccines. Sir Andrew Witty, the British former head of the global drugs giant GSK, was appointed alongside Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the chair of Gavi.
Britain has been one of the biggest supporters of the global effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, providing £250m for international research on the disease at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Angela Merkel has said the coronavirus pandemic is “still at the beginning” and parts of Germany may be rushing their exit from lockdown, as divided EU leaders clashed at a video summit over a desperately needed Europe-wide recovery fund.
Worried that Germans were relaxing physical distancing efforts amid the reopening of smaller shops this week, the chancellor said some of Germany’s 16 states were moving too fast and the country remained “on the thinnest ice” despite its early achievements.
Germany has the fifth highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, but has managed to keep its death toll down to just over 5,000, a far lower tally than in many other countries, mainly through early and extensive testing.
“It is precisely because the figures give rise to hope that I feel obliged to say that this interim result is fragile,” Merkel told parliament. “We are still far from out of the woods. We are not in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning.”
Christian Drosten, the director of the Institute for Virology at Berlin’s Charité hospital, said reopening shopping malls and larger stores could trigger a second wave in May and June, and the country risked “gambling away” its early advantage. Schools in Germany are due to reopen from 4 May and Merkel and state leaders are due to meet again on 30 April to review how to proceed after that.
In France, Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that a detailed plan to exit lockdown would be unveiled early next week. Pupils will return to French schools from 11 May, and the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said he hoped retailers other than restaurants, bars and cafes could reopen from the same date.
“We want all retail outlets to be able to open in the same way, out of fairness,” said Le Maire. Bars and restaurants were unlikely to reopen before mid-June “because they are places of mixing”, he added.
Retailers would need to limit the number of people in their shops at one time, Le Maire said, and the hardest-hit regions, such as eastern France and greater Paris, may have to wait longer for shops to reopen. Older people’s movements may also be restricted.
The public health authority chief, Jérome Salomon, said avoiding a second wave of infections remained the priority.
“France’s goal is not to create collective immunity by creating a second and then a third wave,” he told a parliamentary hearing. “That seems too dangerous to us. The goal is to prevent the circulation of the virus, and to create favourable conditions allowing us to gain time before the arrival of effective drugs or vaccines.”
Companies have been told they should encourage employees to continue working from home if they can to limit public transport use, and the government aims to raise its testing programme to about 500,000 tests a week. France has the world’s fourth highest death toll at more than 20,000.
In Italy the northern region of Lombardy, at the centre of Europe’s worst outbreak, began an antibody testing programme as it prepared to start opening up its economy. Blood tests to establish whether someone has had – rather than currently has – the disease will be carried out in 14 of the worst-hit areas before being extended to the whole region next week.
Meanwhile, Sweden’s public health agency revised earlier statements about when the capital Stockholm was believed to have passed the peak of infections. A report by the agency published earlier this week, based on statistical modelling, said the capital region passed the peak of simultaneous infections on 15 April, with 86,000 people believed to be have been infected. But on Thursday it revised the date to 8 April, with 70,500 believed to have been infected.
As EU leaders haggled over a rescue package that has reignited a bitter north-south divide between member states, Merkel also said Germany was ready to make “significantly higher” EU budget contributions to help the bloc cope with the fallout from the pandemic.
She added, however, that calls from some EU countries for common debt with common liabilities were not the way to go. “That would be a very difficult process, cost time and wouldn’t even help anyone in the current situation, since we need rapid-fire instruments to tackle the crisis,” she said.
In other developments:
Global infections passed 2.6 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with nearly 185,000 deaths.
The latest US jobless figures confirmed that 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the past five weeks.
The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia fell for a second day. The figure has remained below record levels for four days, raising hopes that the outbreak there may have reached a plateau.
Greece is extending lockdown measures by a week, to 4 May.
Spain clarified that children aged 14 or under would be allowed out to walk and play in the streets for an hour a day from Sunday as long as they stay within a kilometre of their homes and are accompanied by an adult.
Vietnam eased physical distancing measures, with experts pointing to a decisive response involving mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing for its success in recording just 268 cases and zero deaths.
China said it would give another $30m to the World Health Organization, days after the US said it would freeze funding. The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a fundamental reform of the WHO was needed and that the US may never restore its funding.

Isolated in a recent European Union council of ministers, with attitudes described by European leaders past and present as “repugnant”.
It sounds like an old script of Britain in the EU. Yet it is the Netherlands that has found itself at the heart of the union’s most bitter row during the coronavirus pandemic. As EU leaders meet on Thursday for their fourth virtual crisis summit in seven weeks, the Dutch will once again be in the vanguard of opposition to plans for big spending on the recovery.
British parallels only go so far. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European club and single currency, and does three-quarters of its trade with the EU. A year ago the prime minister, Mark Rutte, gave a sweeping vision of a savvier, more realpolitik-positioned EU in the world. Surveying “the chaos of Brexit”, Rutte said, “there is no such thing as splendid isolation”. Dutch Eurosceptic parties have quietly shelved visions of “Nexit”.
And yet Dutch political scientist Catherine De Vries sees echoes of the British debate. The Dutch political class, which she notes like to describe their country as “the Netherlands Inc” have a transactional attitude to Europe. The Dutch have benefited tremendously from “the tree of European integration”, she observes. “Now that we have been able to reap the fruits of those developments, we are questioning whether we need the tree anymore or do we actually need to water the tree?
“If Dutch politicians don’t explain for a very long time how the Dutch economy benefits from the single market, it’s very difficult to explain why the Dutch should pay for the single market … That reminds me very much of the British discussions.”
The Dutch are hardly alone in keeping a flinty eye on EU spending. With Austria, Denmark and Sweden, the Dutch make up “the frugal four” that helped sink a deal on the next EU budget in February. But no other leader seems to cause as much irritation as Rutte, who arrived at the summit with a biography of Frédéric Chopin to get through that night, because “what else is there to do”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was said to have been irked by Rutte’s “childish” behaviour, the Dutch daily Volkskrant reported.
Rem Korteweg, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, blames “shambolic PR” by the powerful Dutch finance ministry and “poor diplomacy” for the current Dutch EU woes. Exhibit A is the Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, who voiced contrition after remarks questioning why some countries lacked financial buffers to cope with the coronavirus shock provoked a furious reaction.
Korteweg thinks the Dutch also failed to see which way the Germans were leaning in a recent debate on crisis rescue plans, leaving them isolated at a Eurozone finance ministers’ meeting. “On economic and financial issues the Netherlands always likes to be Robin to Germany’s Batman,” he said. But it also suits Germany to have the Dutch “play the bad guy”, he added. “Germany having the Dutch on their outer right-hand flank allows Germany to play a more central and more mediating role.”
Dutch author Joris Luyendijk points to political games ahead of next year’s elections. “One reason the Dutch are so loud is that Hoekstra is positioning himself to succeed Rutte as the Dutch prime minister and for that he needs to look tough. This is very British: playing domestic politics in Brussels.”
However, there are deeper reasons for the cooling romance between Dutch political elites and Brussels. The Dutch, one of the largest small member states, have lost weight since enlargement to eastern Europe. Disaffection was evident in the resounding Dutch no to the EU constitution in 2005, which De Vries sees as opening the way to the more “transactional discourse” about the EU in domestic politics. “That was then exploited by the extreme right,” she says, who fanned claims about “‘an EU superstate and wasteful bureaucracy’.”
Now the Netherlands is coming under pressure from France, Spain and Italy to pledge “solidarity”, code for more spending, either via shared debt, or massive grants to help the worst-hit countries. In an interview with the Financial Times, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, effectively pinned responsibility for the EU’s fate on Germany and the Netherlands agreeing “financial transfers and solidarity”. Anything less would fuel populism in Italy, Spain and perhaps France, the French president argued.
It is an argument that cuts little ice in the Dutch parliament, where Rutte’s government has no majority in either chamber. Earlier this month seven lawmakers tabled a resolution against “debt union”, led by Pieter Omtzigt, an influential voice in the Christian Democratic Appeal party that is part of Rutte’s coalition. Asked if any Dutch government would agree mutualised debt, Omtizgt responded simply: “No.”
Dutch government sources, in common with German ones, think others fail to appreciate big offers already made in the white heat of the crisis, from tearing up EU stability and growth pact rules, to the European Central Bank’s €750bn bond-buying programme and a €540bn rescue package.
As other incumbent leaders across the world, Rutte is enjoying a surge in the polls, while his rivals in the far-right Freedom party and populist Forum for Democracy have been sinking. But politics is volatile. “A move towards eurobonds in March of next year would be a windfall for Forum for Democracy,” suggests Korteweg. “They would want nothing less than that Rutte is forced to sign up to a form of eurobonds and then cash in at the ballot box in March.”
Luyendijk adds: “Macron is half-right because, yes, refusing mutualised debt will fuel populism in the south. But by adopting mutualised debt you are going to fuel populism in the north. Dutch train drivers work till 65 while their French colleagues can retire in their late or even early 50s. Where is the solidarity in that?” But never say never, he says. “Bluntness bordering on boorishness is quintessentially Dutch but so is, in this country of coalitions, flexibility and flip-flopping.”

Several European countries took preliminary steps on Monday towards a return to normal pre-virus life, with some shops reopening in Germany and a resumption of school for pupils slotted to take place next month.
Bookshops, florists, fashion stores, bike and car outlets and other shops smaller than 800 sq m were permitted to reopen on Monday morning. In Berlin a few schools allowed final-year students to sit exams. Pupils arrived wearing face-masks and took their seats at widely spaced desks.
Angela Merkel, however, warned of a possible second wave of coronavirus infection if lockdown measures were abandoned too rapidly. The chancellor urged citizens to stay “determined” and said it would be a “crying shame” if the country which has been praised for its deft handling of the crisis fell into a “relapse”.
In a video call with party colleagues Merkel said the “discussion orgies” taking place in some German federal states on relaxing curbs on were unhelpful. She said she was “greatly concerned” the public might let its guard down.
Nonetheless, the clear trend across Europe is now towards some form of normalisation. Norway’s government reopened nurseries on Monday after a month-long closure.
It said this was possible because children were less affected by Covid-19, adding that the virus was under control. “Going to pre-school is safe,” Norway’s education minister, Guri Melby, declared.
Some parents, however, have criticised the move – a sentiment also seen in Denmark, where primary schools reopened last week. A Norwegian Facebook group called “My child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19” has gathered nearly 30,000 signatures.
Polls suggest around a quarter of Norwegian parents do not want to send their children back to pre-school.
In Poland parks and forests returned to normal on Monday, while in the Czech Republic open-air markets were allowed to resume as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions. “This is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest,” vegetable grower Milan Vystejn told Reuters, at his stand in Prague’s Tylovo Square.
Austria has already reopened some shops. It plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May. All three countries have seen significantly fewer coronavirus deaths than the worst affected countries in Europe: Italy, Spain, France and the UK.
All European leaders are battling with the same dilemma: how to prevent a renewed outbreak of the virus while at the same time maintaining public confidence, as poorer citizens run out of cash and national economies nosedive.
There are growing signs of unrest. Over the weekend police in Berlin struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning against the lockdown. Among them were anti-vaxxers, well known conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship.
In France, meanwhile, there was unrest in the Paris suburb of Villeneuve-La-Garenne, after a motorcyclist collided with the open door of an unmarked police car during a pursuit. Skirmishes lasted into the early hours of Sunday and resumed again on Monday. Protesters burned cars and hurled fireworks at police, whom they accuse of heavy-handed behaviour. In the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, meanwhile, demonstrators protested against the local authorities and the country’s continuing lockdown. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters pelting the police with rocks, and police making several arrests.
On Monday France’s prime minister, Édouard Philippe, said nurseries, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 11 May.
Philippe said the French government was considering options to implement the policy, including having half a class in rotation, or first opening schools in areas where there had been few or no Covid-19 cases. However, he warned the French not to plan too far ahead, saying weddings, parties, and travel outside of France were not immediately on the cards.
“I don’t have answers today … given the barrier rules, it doesn’t seem reasonable that a marriage of say 200 people gathered in a confined place is to be envisaged. For how long I don’t know,” Philippe admitted.
In Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, the authorities have said they will hold off lifting restrictions. The rate of infection appears to be going down. The country reported 399 coronavirus deaths over the past 48 hours, lower than Sunday’s figure of 410.
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, is expected to ask parliament on Tuesday to extend a national lockdown until 11 May. He has proposed that from 27 April children under the age of 12 should be allowed out for exercise – but not teenagers.

The global number of deaths topped 165,000 with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University.
Australia reopened three of Sydney’s beaches but only for exercise. “Activities such as sitting on the sand, sun-baking or gathering in groups will not be permitted,” said Danny Said, a local mayor.
India allowed some industrial and agricultural work to resume, even as the country recorded its single biggest-day rise in coronavirus cases.
In Iran, where the outbreak has killed at least 5,000 people, some major shopping centres opened, including Tehran’s historic grand bazaar. The move follows an easing of some social distancing rules last week. Working hours are restricted until 6pm.
Hong Kong recorded no new coronavirus cases on Monday for the first time since early March, health authorities said. The city has had 1,025 confirmed cases and four deaths since January when the pandemic began.
Ghana ended a three-week lockdown on two key regions including the capital, Accra, and Kumasi. In a televised address the president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said testing had improved, adding that quarantine restrictions were having a severe impact on the poor.

"59";"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/20/malcolm-turnbull-on-donald-trump-you-dont-suck-up-to-bullies";2020-04-20;"Former Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull on Donald Trump: 'You don't suck up to bullies'";"In this extract from his memoir, the former Australian prime minister recounts his deals and negotiations with the US president
“Don’t worry, Malcolm. The American people will never elect a lunatic to sit in this office.”
So Barack Obama had enigmatically assured me in the Oval Office in January 2016, when I asked him about the presidential race.
Well, it was now November and the unthinkable had happened.
And lunatic or not, Trump had won.
It wasn’t only Americans who were stunned. Nobody had expected a Trump victory and truthfully few were prepared for it.
He’d run a bombastic campaign, much of which seemed to us to be designed to ensure he wouldn’t win. What sort of candidate would refer to his opponent, a distinguished former first lady and secretary of state, with a nickname like “Crooked Hillary” and beam as his supporters chanted “Lock her up”? How could you get elected in (by Australian standards) prudish America when you have talked about “grabbing” women “by the pussy”?
We knew what he’d said in the campaign, but did he mean it? After all, everyone seemed to accept he didn’t expect to win. Was the whole campaign just an enormous exercise in self-promotion?
Every country and every leader tried to work out how to deal with Trump. Elaborate psychological analyses were written in foreign capitals – including our own. The general conclusion was that Trump was a narcissist who’d respond well to flattery. “Lay it on with a trowel” was the consensus, echoing former British PM Benjamin Disraeli’s advice on how to deal with royalty.
I felt this approach was quite mistaken. I’d never met Trump or dealt with him but knew plenty of people who had. He was typical of more than a few of the billionaires I’ve known – Kerry Packer, Conrad Black, Jimmy Goldsmith and Bob Maxwell, just to name a few. And the one thing I’d learned with bullies is that sucking up to them is precisely the wrong way to go.
Just as imperial powers regard deference as their due, so do bullies – especially powerful ones – expect to be flattered. It doesn’t win respect, nor does it earn gratitude. And if the bully in question is a particularly manipulative one, the flattery will be used against you. Personalities like that often appear utterly lacking in emotional intelligence, devoid of empathy. But that’s not the whole picture: in my experience, the successful narcissistic bully is able to manipulate others effectively because he has a keen sense of others’ vulnerabilities. Like any predator, he can sense fear and weakness from miles away.
So, the best way to deal with someone like Trump is to be frank and forthright. Be yourself, always be courteous – there’s nothing to be gained from rudeness or scratchiness. But stand your ground. That suited me.
There was a scramble to contact Trump once the election result was known. He had no transition team in place, but, thanks to Joe Hockey, I got a number from US-based Australian golfing great Greg Norman and I was able to call Trump on 10 November and pass on my congratulations. However, a major storm awaited us.
I’d agreed the refugee deal with Obama, in principle, at the White House in January 2016. It took some time to settle the terms of the deal and it was signed when I was in New York for the UN’s leaders’ week in September. As previously mentioned, both sides recognised we were better off not announcing it during the campaign lest Trump seize on it and make an issue of it.
So, the deal was announced on 13 November and the Department of Homeland Security got straight to work; 14 US officials arrived in Nauru in early December and started interviews. Naturally, we were anxious to ensure that the rightwing media in the US, especially Fox News, didn’t latch on to the deal and make it an issue, so we were careful to say as little as possible.
I spoke with Trump’s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, on 7 December and he gave me every impression they’d stick with the deal, recognising the importance of the US-Australian relationship.
In late January, we learned that Trump was proposing a new executive order to put a ban on refugees from Muslim countries – and it was immediately reported on as scuttling the refugee deal. After a very helpful introduction from Australian-born Dow Chemicals CEO Andrew Liveris, I called Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who conferenced in Trump’s immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, and pressed on them the importance of sticking with the bargain I’d made with Obama. They were sympathetic and assured me the new executive order wouldn’t prevent the refugee deal going ahead.
Over the days that followed, we reached out to everyone we could in the new administration. In a discussion with Julie Bishop, Vice-President Pence assured her that the Trump administration would honour the deal. National security adviser Mike Flynn gave a similar assurance to Justin Bassi, his counterpart in my office. We felt our frantic lobbying had worked.
Our optimism was reinforced on 27 January when the executive order came out with language that expressly enabled the administration to admit refugees otherwise prohibited by the order if “admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement”.
Thanks, Jared!
Immediately, a call with Trump was set up for 9am Sunday, Sydney time. We’d been assured the refugee deal was agreed, so we worked on the other topics to discuss.
Then the sky fell in. Just as I got to the office, Mike Flynn called Justin Bassi and Pence called Julie Bishop – both with the message that the president had changed his mind. He wouldn’t, under any circumstances, honour the deal and would I please not even mention it.
We were in the prime minister’s office in Sydney, looking down over the harbour with all of its benign tranquillity. I feared the call was going to be a rough ride. And it was.
Trump sounded tired. He was friendly enough at the outset but his mood quickly changed. As soon as I raised the refugee deal he became angry, repeating again and again that honouring the Obama deal would “kill him” and “embarrass him”. He said, “I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.”
I described how the deal was fair, benefiting the US too. And the people on Manus and Nauru were not a security risk. But if you come by boat, you can’t get into Australia. “Even if you were a Nobel prize winner,” I said. So you’re a new CEO: you inherit some deals you don’t like; you honour them, take a writedown and blame your predecessor.
Trump argued that, as a businessman, I must have torn up deals. I told him I hadn’t. I believed promises should be kept, whether by companies or countries. I didn’t make commitments lightly, and kept them when I did.
As his anger rose, Trump kept talking over the top of me, with more intensity; it was as though at times he was talking to himself or perhaps the people in the room, which of course included Steve Bannon, one of the deal’s fiercest opponents.
At one point, I looked up from the phone across my desk at [media adviser] David Bold – his face was white with horror – so I turned to look out the window instead. I had to get Trump to commit to the deal. Not only was it vital for our whole plan to resettle the refugees without getting the people smugglers back in business, an early rejection by Trump would be a political catastrophe in Australia.
So, I reasoned with Trump and finally won him over.
At the end of it all, I still wasn’t sure that Trump would stick to the deal.
The tone and the content of the call had been dynamite. We’d had nobody from my department or from the Department of Foreign Affairs present. We kept the transcript of the call secure and didn’t release it to the bureaucracy in the usual way. Not that we didn’t trust them, but at times you can’t be too careful.
Our plan had been to keep the whole thing very low-key. The deal was going ahead; Trump didn’t like it but he was a man of his word and he was sticking with it.
As the media interest grew, it appeared Trump was having cold feet as on 2 February he tweeted: “Do you believe it? The Obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!”
Later that day someone, presumably in the White House, briefed the Washington Post about the call; it described Trump “blasting me”, quoted him telling me this was his worst call so far and that the deal I’d struck with Obama was the worst deal ever; it described his accusing me of planning to send him the “next Boston bombers” – although it omitted to mention my riposte that the refugees on Nauru and Manus, unlike the Boston bombers, weren’t from Chechnya.
The Post noted that the US embassy in Canberra had stated the White House had confirmed the refugee deal was going ahead “one hour and forty minutes before Trump suggested in a tweet that it might not go ahead”.
We assumed the leak had come from Bannon; his motive would have been either to produce enough heat to force Trump to renege on his commitment to me or, at the very least, to demonstrate to Trump’s base that he’d agreed to the deal only through the most gritted of teeth.
Back in Australia, I declined to comment on media reports about the call, simply restating that Trump had agreed to honour the deal and that the conversation had been frank and courteous. I expressly rejected the claim that he’d hung up on me – as the transcript shows he did not.
The leaking of the details and later the transcript of the call had the opposite of its intended effect. The refugee deal had never been a big news story in the US, despite the Australian media’s attempts to make it so. However, berating one of America’s closest allies was a big story and both fans of Australia and critics of Trump lined up to express their solidarity with us.
For our part, it was working out well. Trump and/or Bannon had over-reached and now we had the upper hand. More importantly, unlike my counterparts leading other countries, I’d got off on the right foot with Trump. We’d had a row, that’s true, but I’d stood my ground on a point of principle and he’d conceded.
However, we needed to ensure the personal relationship was as warm and positive as possible and so considerable effort was made to arrange a suitable visit for me to the United States to meet Trump for the first time.
The Australian American Association had been planning a dinner on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, to be held in New York on 4 May. The timing was less than ideal for me, just before the budget, but the setting on the USS Intrepid – where Australian and US veterans of the battle would also attend – and the occasion were both ideal.
Trump's deference to Murdoch was greater than I’ve ever seen from any Australian politician
The Battle of the Coral Sea was a major turning point in the Pacific war, when a combined US and Australian fleet turned back a Japanese armada heading to seize Port Moresby and cut off Australia from its US ally.
Jared Kushner told me on 1 May that Trump was still hurt about the refugee deal. “He hadn’t expected you’d come on so strong, although we knew that was your reputation.” I told him I didn’t think the call was so bad. “Malcolm, it was bad.” He told me Rupert Murdoch, whose father had founded the Australian American Association, had persuaded Trump to go to the function on the Intrepid, and he urged me to be low-key and deferential.
When Trump arrived, he was accompanied by Rudy Giuliani and Rupert Murdoch. His deference to Murdoch was greater than I’ve ever seen from any Australian politician and was in marked contrast to the high-handed way Trump treats most people. When he asked me if Rupert could join us for our bilateral discussion between leaders, I told him that wasn’t a good idea, adding: “The rest of the media will kill us; let’s catch up with him later.”
For a first meeting, we covered a lot of ground. He talked about Kerry Packer a lot; he knew I’d been Kerry’s lawyer and “kept him out of jail”, something Donald mentioned every time we met. Most billionaires keep an eye out for a good lawyer in a tight corner. He is a big fan of Greg Norman and described in detail several tournaments he felt Greg had unfairly lost.
Trump is a natural isolationist. Whether it was east Asia or the Middle East, Trump’s perspective was thoroughly dystopian. Everyone hated each other, had done for centuries and wasn’t going to change. So the less the US had to do with them the better.
After we’d had our one-on-one discussion and the media had left us, Donald suggested we ask Lucy and Melania to join us. Melania was found first and Donald described the refugee deal. By now he knew, just as I had told him, there were no security risks among the refugees.
“Melania, do you know, Malcolm has 2,000 of the worst terrorists in the world locked up on a desert island and that fool Obama agreed to take them. Can you believe that? And now Malcolm has talked me into taking them too! He got me to do something I promised never to do! He is a tough negotiator!”
Melania smiled, faintly and mischievously. “Just like you, Donald,” she said.
The subject of an incandescent row a few months before was now something to make light of. It was just another deal.
The other significant problem we faced was trade.
When we met privately in Manila in November at the East Asia Summit, he asked me what I thought would happen if he banned all Chinese imports into the United States. “A global depression,” I said, as quietly as I could. He was clearly straining with frustration, and returned again and again to the “$350bn trade deficit, but it’s really more like $500bn, Malcolm”.
From my point of view, I could only do so much in trying to talk Trump around on trade generally – it was pretty clear that he had longstanding protectionist views he wasn’t going to change.
When he started threatening, early in his presidency, to take action to protect US industry by imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, he was strongly encouraged by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross as well as his trade advisers Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, who as far as I could tell simply wanted to use American muscle to extract better trade terms with other countries.
My singular objective was to protect Australia’s interests. If Trump was going to play havoc with global trade, I had to do my very best to protect Australia, to differentiate us so that we weren’t just another ally who was going to get run over by the Trump bulldozer.
So, after a lot of toing and froing between our embassy and the White House and between the various ministers and officials, it all came down – as it always does with Trump – to the great man himself.
'Emmanuel,' he said, 'do you know Malcolm is the best lawyer in the world?'
After the love-in on the Intrepid, our next encounter had been in July at the G20 in Hamburg, hosted by Angela Merkel. She was a very courteous host but it was obvious she couldn’t stand Trump, and the feeling was mutual.
The challenge was finding a time to pin him down on the issue. He was certainly full of good cheer, inviting Lucy and me to ride in his car – “the Beast” – with him and Melania, and generally radiating bonhomie.
Trump was even good-natured about my supposedly “off the record” remarks at the press gallery ball in Canberra three weeks before. I’d given a rather Trumpian speech which brought the house down and, when it was leaked, went viral in the US. “So, you’ve been having a little fun at my expense, Malcolm?” Donald asked.
“Very affectionately,” I replied.
“It’s not bad.” He shrugged. “Lots of people think you are better than Alec Baldwin.”
Still, he knew I wanted a commitment on steel and he wasn’t going to make it easy.
Finally, we agreed to catch up after one of the plenary sessions and so we headed off to find a meeting room. On the way, Emmanuel Macron joined us, as did Theresa May. In vain, I did everything short of tripping them both to get them out of the way – whatever they wanted to talk about, I knew it wasn’t Australian steel or aluminium and I needed to get Trump by himself and extract a firm commitment.
Donald stopped and asked me if I’d ever seen his “skiff” – or that’s what it sounded like – and I could only say I hadn’t as I wondered why on earth he was talking about a sailing boat. “Oh, you gotta see it. It is so cool. Nobody, not even the Chinese or the Russians, can hear us in there. It is so secret!” Next thing, we took a right turn and found ourselves being led into a steel box the size of a container. All the while, Donald was explaining how utterly impenetrable it was to even the best bugs.
Of course, for the Scif (secure communications information facility) to work, you have to have the door closed. Even though it probably wasn’t a good idea to have a dozen or more people jammed into it, our trailing entourage piled in. With me were finance minister Mathias Cormann and our G20 sherpa – the senior Australian official guiding the G20 policy process – David Gruen. For Trump, there was at least Wilbur Ross, Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn. Emmanuel was there, as was Theresa, the German G20 sherpa and sundry other officials and diplomats.
Donald, Emmanuel and I were down one end of the Scif and, while I wanted to talk about steel, the president of France wanted to talk about the wording of the communiqué.
Donald wanted to talk about neither. “Emmanuel,” he said, “do you know Malcolm is the best lawyer in the world? The best. He kept my friend Kerry Packer out of jail. Nobody else could have done that.”
I was thinking, is this going to be a routine? So, on cue, I said: “Oh, Donald, it wasn’t that hard. He was innocent.”
Quick as a flash, Donald says with a big grin: “No, he was so guilty, so guilty. Deserved to go to jail forever!”
To say that Macron was astonished by this is an understatement, but the routine continued.
“Emmanuel,” Donald continued, “Malcolm has 2,000 of the worst terrorists in the world – the worst in the world – locked up on a desert island.”
“They aren’t terrorists, Donald,” I wearily replied.
“Oh, yes they are. They are the worst, and that fool Obama – the worst president EVER – agreed to take them to America. Can you believe that? Would you take them, Emmanuel?”
Macron opened his mouth but didn’t say anything; his eyes just got wider.
“But you know what’s worse? Now I have to take them! Malcolm, why do I have to take them?”
“Donald,” I said, “they’re yours. And they are very nice people. You will get on fine.” This was definitely becoming a routine.
To get to steel, I had to help resolve the wording issue with Macron. Trump quite sensibly didn’t really care what was in the communiqué as not only was he never going to read it, neither was anyone else.
Resolving the wording issues got Macron and May out of the Scif so we Australians were able to get down to the purpose of the meeting, which was to extract a commitment from Trump that he wouldn’t impose tariffs on our steel or aluminium. I was particularly concerned about steel because the tariff was higher (25% versus 10% for aluminium) and because our steel industry had been struggling in the face of aggressive import competition from China. Add to that, the second steelmaker, Arrium, based in Whyalla, had gone into bankruptcy.
The setting of the Scif may have been bizarre, but I had to fight for those Australian jobs. I explained to Trump that almost all of the Australian steel exports to the US were of rolled coil made in Port Kembla shipped by BlueScope to Steelscape, its subsidiary in California. Steelscape turned the steel into roofing materials – mostly Colorbond. Trump’s eyes lit up. “Colorbond, comes in bright colours, right?” – it turned out that he was familiar with it. “We used the gold-coloured one in some of our own projects. They really loved it in Brooklyn.”
So in hands-on chief executive style, he started dictating a tweet, with me commenting on it as he went
Why did California need Australian steel? Well, as I described to Trump, the cost of shipping steel across the Pacific was about $40 a tonne versus $100 a tonne from the midwest or east coast steelmakers. So, I argued, if he put a tariff on Australian steel, all that would happen is that the cost of roofing steel on the west coast would go up by about 12.5% with no benefit to US steelmakers – the only winners would be the US Treasury and people who sold competitive non-steel roofing products. And the big loser would be the construction sector and American jobs.
“Donald,” I argued, “you have a great trade deal with us – no tariffs, no quotas and a huge trade surplus. So why would you want to hit us, just because you can?”
Well, we came out of the Scif with a commitment from Trump that there would be no tariffs on Australian steel. Ross argued that only the Colorbond product should be exempted and we discussed the practicality of that, but to both Trump and me that sounded like Wilbur trying to white-ant the deal before it was concluded, so from my point of view, the president had given me a commitment – no tariffs on Australian steel or aluminium, full stop.
I called him again on 10 March. We covered a lot of ground: regional security, China and North Korea as well as my concerns about how the United States and its allies had lost – and should work together to regain – leadership in wireless technology and especially 5G.
But my focus remained persuading him from imposing tariffs on our steel or aluminium. So I went through the big surpluses America had with Australia and how their trade deal with Australia should be their ideal. I sensed, as I had before, that he didn’t want to get pinned down to make a commitment, but I pressed on.
“Donald,” I said: “you can use Australia as an argument because you can say we have a level playing field, we have a surplus, so we aren’t going to impose steel tariffs.” He could, I argued, say to other countries: “If you want to have no tariffs, give us a level playing field like the Australians do. Fair and reciprocal trade.”
Trump liked the term “fair and reciprocal” a lot. That was very promising; that was a better theme for his trade policy than the American “might is right” message, which might go down well in the midwest but was so corrosive of American goodwill everywhere else in the world.
So in hands-on chief executive style, he started dictating a tweet, with me commenting on it as he went. How many years had we been an ally? Two hundred? “No, just one hundred to 4 July this year,” I said. And at one point we nearly had “the great state of Australia” in the message – “Perhaps nation,” I suggested.
It was a practical and good-humoured collaboration. We even compared our Twitter followers (he had 158 million, I had only 1 million), and finally settled on a very plain announcement saying that because of our fair and reciprocal military and trading relationship, the US would not impose steel or aluminium tariffs on the great nation of Australia.
And aluminium only just made it. I was so fixated on steel, it was only at the last moment I reminded him to include aluminium. No problems, steel and aluminium it was.
Trump’s tweet, when it came out, was slightly different: “Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!’
We were taken aback by the reference to a security agreement – it hadn’t been mentioned in the call with Trump – but we were assured both directly and via our embassy that this had been inserted by the White House lawyers, and that it didn’t detract from the president’s unequivocal commitment.
On 22 March, Trump’s proclamation on steel imposed tariffs on all countries with the exception of Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil and the EU – pending further negotiations. It wasn’t the unequivocal exemption we’d agreed, but it was a step forward. The challenge now was, in the midst of all of the Washington chaos, to hang on to it.
When the protectionists advising Trump continued to push for a quota on Australia, I had another call with the president on 22 May to try to turn him around.
Trump started determined that we would have a quota, and his concern was that if Australia was exempted, it would create a precedent. So my job was to persuade him that the singular position of Australia meant that it was in his interest to exempt us.
I said: “When we last spoke we agreed there would be no tariffs on Australian steel and aluminium, we actually tweeted it and said that to the world, that was the agreement ... This is really a political issue of principle, it’s not really an economic issue ... People will say, why have you got no tariffs on Australia? Is it because of the military alliance? And you can say, no, it’s because it is fair and reciprocal, that’s my principle, I want a level playing field. The Aussies have no tariffs and no quotas on us.”
Once again Trump saw the logic in our case and agreed that not only would there be no tariffs on our steel or aluminium but no quotas either.
Ever since he was elected Trump has dominated the headlines in a way no other president has before. While many self-styled conservatives support him, he is not one of them. Conservatives defend and support established institutions. Radical, populist, Trump, the authoritarian iconoclast, takes them all on.
The economy, so far, has boomed under Trump. He has certainly delivered “jobs and growth”. However, looked at from afar, America seems more divided, angry and polarised than I can remember. Libraries are being filled with analyses of Trump’s wilful and intemperate nature, his “chaotic” administration, scandals and conspiracies, real and imagined.
Traditional political issues have been overwhelmed. The political debate has been distilled into one issue: Trump’s giant personality.
He says America is more respected than ever. It depends what you mean by respect. Strength is respected when it is matched with values consistently advanced. Around the world, Trump’s deliberate unpredictability generates fear rather than respect, anxiety rather than certainty. His view of the world is much closer to the “don’t tread on me” isolationists of centuries past than it is the neoconservatives who, after the fall of the Soviet Union, sought to remake the world in America’s image.
In our own region he has started, but not yet settled, a trade war with China. The Covid-19 crisis will no doubt further encourage protectionism. It seems impossibly far off at the moment, but at some point an expanded and enhanced Trans-Pacific Partnership that includes China and the United States should be the goal.
At summits in Singapore and Hanoi, he has feted and flattered Kim Jong-un, who hasn’t denuclearised and continues to test his missiles. So far, at least, the leader of the most powerful nation in the world appears to have been outmanoeuvred by the tyrant leader of a bankrupt slave state.
Trump is not a warmonger. And as he promised in his campaign, he is working to disentangle America from its engagement in the Middle East and Afghanistan, learning, as he has often said, that it is easier to get into these wars than to get out of them.
America may be stronger in economic and military terms, but its influence is diminished. In fact, under Trump, America seeks less influence, not least by rejecting many of the global institutions created by the US after the second world war.
Most consequential of all, I fear, will be his withdrawal from the Paris agreement. The world will struggle to meet the challenge of global warming without American leadership. And wherever Trump creates a leadership vacuum, others will fill it, often with values very different to our own.
But as the prime minister of Australia, my job was to protect our own particular interests and, as far as I could, influence him to act in a way that advanced our wider interests, in particular the continued commitment of the United States to our region. And in that regard, dramatic flourishes aside, he has not let us down. The “indispensable nation” is nowhere more so than in our hemisphere.
We had a row over the refugee deal, but it is being implemented. A large number have been safely resettled in the US after very careful security assessments. And we are fulfilling our side of the bargain too. He wouldn’t have done the deal, that’s true, but it was a fair one nonetheless.
Our only other contentious issue was the steel and aluminium tariffs.
There, defying the stereotypes, he was both thoughtful and good humoured. He started off with a different point of view, but listened to my arguments carefully. I didn’t solely base my case on our hundred years of mateship, or the Anzus alliance. A century of solidarity does matter a lot, and especially in Washington. But the US has a lot of allies. My arguments persuaded him because I correctly couched them as being in his interest.
If the Australian trade relationship is your ideal – fair and reciprocal, no tariffs, no quotas and, as it happens, a big surplus – then you should treat us differently to others where the playing field is far from level.
For all of Trump’s so-called madness, in my own dealings with him I found him no less rational than many other billionaires I have dealt with over the years. For all of our differences, as two businessmen, we spoke the same language.

"60";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/germany-ease-lockdown-harder";2020-04-18;"Germany is cautiously starting to ease its lockdown – but it's harder than it looks";"Relaxation measures for schools have been criticised from all sides
The coronavirus has been kind to Germany’s political elite. After years of bleeding votes to the Alternative für Deutschland on the right and the Greens on the left, Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union has finally started to see rising approval ratings. It’s easy to see why. The country’s lockdown was enacted relatively swiftly and presented clearly, its testing programme has been unparalleled in the western world and its healthcare system has proven far more robust than those of neighbouring countries. Now, however, with the virus seemingly in retreat and parts of Europe tentatively easing out of lockdown, tensions are beginning to show, and Germans may soon look back on the quarantine with a kind of nostalgia.
The most immediate cause of contention has been a report by the Leopoldina, Germany’s National Academy of Sciences. The report, which suggests a gradual easing of restrictions, places special emphasis on opening schools and returning to free-market principles as quickly as possible. Merkel’s announcement on Wednesday of a loosening of restrictions seems largely to follow the guidelines provided by the institute – some shops will reopen from Monday. Bookstores, car dealerships and bike shops will be allowed to reopen regardless of size, while other shops will be allowed to open only if they are small enough (800 square metres or less), and are able to present adequate plans for maintaining hygiene. Schools will begin reopening on 4 May, with special emphasis on graduating classes, the oldest primary school children and students who are expected to take exams.
The government has emphasised repeatedly that the relaxation of the measures is provisional and that continued progress will require the development of sophisticated contact-tracing programmes, including the controversial suggestion that smartphones be used in a widespread programme to track interactions between citizens. The “fragile partial success,” Merkel has insisted, can only hold if the population continues to abide by social distancing regulations as much as possible.
The plan to reopen some shops has been largely greeted with muted relief, though there doesn’t seem to be much hope that it will stimulate the economy more broadly. The plan for reopening schools has been roundly criticised. The Leopoldina’s guidelines for maintaining social distance and proper hygiene at schools are “just not realistic,” as Ilke Hoffmann, the head of the education union, Gewerkschaft Erzeihung und Wissenschaften, told Der Spiegel. There aren’t enough teachers to maintain class sizes of 15 students or less, as the report suggests, and classrooms are far too small to maintain a two-metre distance between students. Furthermore, the report’s claim that older primary school students would be able to abide by social distancing strictures has been roundly criticised, with teachers calling the idea a fantasy. Harriet Kühnemann, the director of a primary school in Gießen, Hesse, told NTV that she “absolutely cannot guarantee that students will wash their hands”.
While plans to reopen primary schools have been criticised for moving too quickly, the Leopoldina’s recommendation that nurseries stay closed until the end of the summer break in August or September has been widely condemned as too restrictive. The theologian and ethicist Peter Dabrock, for example, has said the decision endangers the wellbeing of children. Closing daycare for six months, Dabrock told Deutschland Funk, would constitute “a massive violation of the rights of children”. Heinz Holger, the president of the Deutschen Kinderschutzbundes, a child welfare organisation, warned that such a long closure had already led to increased calls to their domestic violence hotline. Parental groups, meanwhile, have pointed out that many families already face enormous financial difficulty due to the lack of childcare.
The inept recommendations of the Leopoldina can hardly be surprising given its membership. The panel that issued the report consisted of 24 men and two women. The average age of its members was over 60. One wonders how the institution arrived at the conclusion that it was more important to include a physicist specialising in the “mechanics of materials” than experts on the experiences of immigrants, people of colour, or women. Professor Jutta Allmendinger, a member of the Leopoldina (though not a signatory of its report), had no trouble in assembling a more diverse group of signatories to an open letter criticising the report – more than 40 female professors from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds have signed the letter calling for daycare centres to be opened more quickly.
As the burden of the coronavirus begins to be distributed more and more unevenly, and as women and the young are forced to bear more and more of the weight of the crisis, one suspects that many Germans will look with bitter envy towards Denmark, whose prime minister, Mette Friedriksen – a 42-year-old mother – has made early childhood education the first priority as the country emerges from lockdown. Denmark’s experts have concluded that it is not the young but the elderly who should bear the burden of social isolation during the remainder of the pandemic. The very young, who are generally not at risk from the virus, should not have to sacrifice important educational opportunities so that those who belong to at-risk groups can return to public life more quickly. It’s no coincidence that Germany, in contrast, is keeping the youngest children in isolation, while hair salons and department stores are being allowed to reopen. Ending lockdown is not an end in itself, as the German government has made clear, but even getting that right in a country that has excelled so far is proving to be harder than imagined.
